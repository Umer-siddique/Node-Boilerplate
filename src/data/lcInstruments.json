It as well offers guidance to settle conflict of law matters.   The Convention sets forth the basic principles of law for independent undertakings in a manner which fully assures their independent nature, which guarantees widest possible party autonomy and which establishes a uniform international legal standard for limits to the exception for fraudulent or abusive drawings.",

This Convention was welcomed by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC).  ICC rules cannot be fully effective in all countries without their being recognized under local law. In this respect, the United Nations Convention on Independent Guarantees and Stand-by Letters of Credit provides an important impetus to attain this objective. The Convention was drafted in full recognition of the role of the various ICC rules in this field.",

The text of the Convention reflects a deliberate policy to minimize departures from the content of common and civil law systems, preserving, where possible, the rules on which those systems concur. Where conflicts exist, requiring selection of one system's rule or a compromise solution, the Convention introduces a number of novel provisions. Another group of new rules are the result of special efforts to have the Convention respond to modern commercial needs and banking and financial market practices.  According to the Convention, a bill of exchange is a written instrument which: a) contains an unconditional order whereby the drawer directs the drawee to pay a definite sum of money to the payee or to its order; b) is payable on demand or at a definite time; c) is dated; and d) is signed by the drawer. A promissory note is a written instrument which: a) contains an unconditional promise whereby the maker undertakes to pay a definite sum of money to the payee or to its order; b) is payable on demand or at a definite time; c) is dated; d) is signed by the maker.",

Applicable national laws are used if no mention is made.  The Convention is similar to the Convention Providing a Uniform Law For Bills of Exchange and Promissory Notes (Geneva, 7 June 1930), though that Convention is most relevant for civil law systems."

These rules allow for the determination of the role and responsibilities of all parties undertaking international transactions involving documentary credits.  Compared to the previous version (UCP 500, 1993), UCP 600 are composed by a reduced number of rules (39 instead of 49), add new sections on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153definitions\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153interpretations\u00e2\u20ac\u009d of ambiguous terms (such as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153honour\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153negotiation\u00e2\u20ac\u009d), replace the phrase \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reasonable time\u00e2\u20ac\u009d for acceptance of refusal of documents with the a firm period of five banking days, provide for the discounting of deferred payment credits and allow banks to accept an insurance document that contains reference to any exclusion clause.",
        "relevant": "The UCP 600 create a set of rules to overcome the conflicting laws on the letter of credit in different countries.  Documentary credits offer significant protections especially to the exporter, and thus can encourage international trade.  Drafted by the International Chamber of Commerce, the UCP 600 are the most used regulations governing payment matters in international sales.",
        "aditional": "The UCP 600 are only applicable if parties to a contract specifically agree to their usage. The role of States is thus to encourage their usage among businesses concerned."

It is adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (New York, 9 May 1992).  The Kyoto Protocol concerns six gases (CO2, CH4, N2O, HFC, PFC and SF6).  Developed countries are required to lower their emissions of these noxious gases by at least 5% below the 1990 levels.  The requirements vary by State but must be established at least between 2008 and 2012.  In order to achieve these objectives, State parties are required to improve their energy yield, reform their energy and transport sectors, promote the usage of renewable energies and to protect their forests. Some flexibility is offered to States that cannot reduce their internal emissions enough to satisfy their international obligations. The Protocol includes three market-based instruments known as the Kyoto Mechanisms that allow countries to earn or buy credits outside their borders. States may also fulfil their obligations by financing projects leading to the reduction of greenhouse gases.  These projects may be undertaken on either their own territory or that of another State.",
        "relevant": "In addition to protecting health and the environment, the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 prevents States from establishing discriminatory practices related to international trade under the guise of greenhouse gas protections. Developing countries are not restricted by the Kyoto Protocol, even those that emit the most greenhouse gases.  Signatory developing countries benefit, however, from greenhouse gas reduction projects financed on their territory.",

Each Contracting Party agrees to cooperate for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity. They also agree to share genetic resources and to provide financial support and incentives towards national activities that are intended to achieve the objectives of the Convention.   The Cartagena Protocol (29 January 2000) seeks to protect biological diversity from the potential risks posed by living modified organisms resulting from modern biotechnology.  It establishes an Advance Informed Agreement (AIA) procedure which ensures that countries are provided with the information necessary to make informed decisions before agreeing to the import of such organisms into their territory (the protocol is concerned with seeds and products destined for animal and human consumption).",

This plant protection organization provides for the issuance of certificates relating to phytosanitary conditions, the distribution of information within the country regarding pests of plants, and research and investigation in the field of plant protection.   Each State party may implement its own restrictions or requirements concerning the import of plants or plant products.   The present 1951 Convention was first revised in 1979 to address manufactured products that could threaten plants.

The treaty implements the principles of the European Energy Charter (17 December 1991). The Treaty has four major sections : investment protection, trading in energy, energy products and energy transit.  The treaty calls for the development of open energy markets. It also promotes direct investment in the energy sector under the principle of non-discrimination.   It as well acknowledges the sovereignty of a state over its energy resources and recognizes the necessity for a State to have an environmentally friendly and efficient energy policy. There is an arbitration mechanism for disputes in connection with the Treaty under Part V.   These disputes may be between investors and contracting parties, or between contracting parties.  The Energy Charter Protocol (17 December 1994) provides guidance on the development of energy efficiency programs, indicates areas of cooperation, and provides a framework for the development of co-operative and coordinated action.   The Protocol has three objectives.  First, to promote energy efficiency policies consistent with sustainable development.  Second, to create conditions which induce producers and consumers to use energy as efficiently and environmentally sound as possible (particularly through the organization of efficient energy markets and a recognition of environmental costs and benefits).  Third, to foster cooperation in the field of energy efficiency. The Amendment to the Trade-Related Provisions of the Energy Charter Treaty of 17 December 1994 (Brussels, 24 April 1998) provides interim measures on trade related matters so as to integrate the Agreements of the Uruguay Round of the World Trade Organization.",

State parties meet periodically at the Energy Charter Conference.  There is also a Secretariat which provides the Charter Conference with all necessary assistance for the performance of its duties.  The Secretariat also carries out certain functions assigned to it in the Treaty."

It was designed to prevent industrialized countries from dumping their hazardous wastes in developing and Eastern European Countries.  The primary objectives of the Basel Convention are to ensure that the generation of hazardous waste is reduced to a minimum whenever possible, to reduce the trans-boundary movement of hazardous wastes and other wastes by disposing it in the country of generation, to establish enhanced controls on export and import of hazardous waste, to prevent the trans-boundary movement of hazardous wastes if those will not be managed in an environmentally sound manner and to co-operate in the exchange of information, technology transfer, the harmonization of standards, codes and guidelines and prevention of illegal traffic. An amendment adopted on 22 September 1995 (36 ratifications as of 2003) prohibits exports of hazardous wastes from EU States, OECD States and Liechtenstein to all other Parties to the Convention. The Protocol of 10 December 1999 establishes rules on liability and compensation for damages caused by oil spills of hazardous waste during export, import or during disposal.",
        "relevant": "The present Convention does not forbid the international transfer of hazardous waste but rather provides regulation.  Developing countries as traditional destination areas of hazardous waste, can continue to benefit from revenues out of this trade, at the same time they are given the power to prevent such materials from reaching their territory.  Developing countries also benefit from technology transfer guiding the disposal of hazardous waste.",
        "aditional": "The provisions of the Basel Convention do not apply to the transfer of nuclear waste.  A Conference of the Parties is established to review and evaluate the effective implementation of the Convention.  Its Secretariat is headquartered in Geneva."

Upon completion of the trial period and satisfactory implementation of anti-corruption legislation, they can become participants in the Working Group and adhere to the Convention. The OECD Working Group on Bribery is required to publish periodic reports analyzing the application of the Convention by the State parties."

In their mutual relations, existing rules of the European Union prevail over the rules arising from the present Convention.  Secondary legislation of the European Union is considered as a certain type of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153internal law\u00e2\u20ac\u009d as opposed to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153international treaty law\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, because it creates harmonized rules applying to a sub-group of Member States to a global treaty. An international treaty prevails over Secondary Union Law, unless explicitly provided otherwise. The present Protocol is an example of such derogation. Member States to the Protocol and the European Union benefit from the uniform application of Secondary Union Law.

A Contracting State may request the court or other competent authority of another Contracting State to order the return of a cultural object illegally exported from the territory.

Despite its popularity, however, is has often been criticized for offering few tools to stop the trade in stolen and looted art.   Under this Convention, State Parties recognize that the illicit import, export and transfer of ownership of cultural property is one of the main causes of the impoverishment of the cultural heritage of the countries of origin of such property and that international co-operation constitutes one of the most efficient means of protecting each country's cultural property.  In order to limit such trade, State parties agree to provide for measures ensuring that exported goods can be traced and agree to improve controls to prevent the import of goods using fraudulent methods. It has been criticised that member State are able to keep their own national laws regarding the protection of cultural property, that the text utilizes broad and unspecific language, and that no specific enforcement mechanisms are provided.  As most of the member States are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153source\u00e2\u20ac\u009d countries, the effectiveness of the present Convention is further limited. Another criticism stems from the fact that the UNESCO Convention only provides protection for art stolen from an inventory and public collection.

It also ensures that compilations of data (databases) or other material, in any form, which by reason of the selection or arrangement of their contents constitute intellectual creations, are protected as such.   Applying mutatis mutandis the provisions of the Bern Convention, the WIPO Copyright Treaty gives authors the exclusive right to authorize the distribution, the renting and the public communication of their works.  Additionally, State parties are required to adopt laws designed to punish those responsible for copyright infringements. Exceptionally, State parties may apply limitations or exceptions to the rights granted if these restrictions do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the author.",

It provides similar provisions compared to the Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (Bern, 9 September 1886) concluded within the framework of WIPO. The provisions of the Universal Copyright Convention are, however, less stringent. The Convention requires that the minimum term of a copyright be the length of the life of the author plus 25 years.  It also mandates that no nation may accord its own nationals stronger copyright protection than that given to nationals of other signatory parties, though a state may make exceptions under certain conditions. A formal copyright notice must appear in all copies of a work and consist of the symbol \u00c2\u00a9, the name of the copyright owner, and the year of first publication.   A State Party, however, may require other formalities, provided domestic works are not favoured over foreign. The Convention was supplemented by two protocols adopted the same day.  The first requires that stateless persons and refugees who have their habitual residence in a State party be assimilated to nationals of that State. The second extends the provisions of the Convention to works published by the UN, its specialized institutions and the Organization of American States.",
        "relevant": "This instrument establishes the exclusive right of authors to use their literary, scientific and cultural works.  By establishing norms slightly less severe than the provisions of the Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (Bern, 9 September 1886), this instrument was signed by many American States and developing countries.",
        "aditional": "In the case of a conflict, the provisions of the 1886 Bern Convention prevail over the provisions of the present Convention if the conflicting States are State Parties to both Conventions."

The rights covered concern the translation, reproduction, public recitation, broadcast and adaptation of literary and artistic works. The Bern Convention is based on three principles: 1) Authors enjoy with respect to their literary and artistic works in countries of the Union other than their country of origin, the rights that their respective laws grant to their nationals, as well as the rights specially granted by the Convention.  2) The enjoyment and the exercise of these rights is not subject to any formality; such enjoyment and such exercise shall be independent of the existence of protection in the country of origin of the work. 3) The protection offered implies that all counterfeit works can be seized within the territory of State parties.   A State party may adopt reservations and conditions on the exclusive right granted to the author, including the reproduction of works when public information demands so require. A system of compulsory licences concerning the public broadcast of works and the recording of musical works is also provided.",

The Hague Agreement of 1925 was revised on 2 June 1934 in London, on 28 November 1960 at The Hague and supplemented by three additional Acts: - The Additional Act of Monaco addressing the question of applicable taxes on the deposits (Monaco, 18 November 1961); - The Complementary Act of Stockholm permitting WIPO to administer the Hague Agreement of 1925 (Stockholm, 14 July 1967); - The Geneva Act included a number of elements aiming at facilitating accession by potential State Parties, such as the possibility of extending the refusal period up to 12 months or fixing a higher designation fee (Geneva, 2 July 1999).",

The Agreement provides for the cases and the manner in which seizure may be requested and effected. It prohibits the use, in connection with the sale or display or offering for sale of any goods, of all indications in the nature of publicity capable of deceiving the public as to the source of the goods. It is reserved to the courts of each member State to decide what appellations do not, on account of their generic character, come within the scope of the Agreement. The Agreement does not provide for the establishment of a Union or any governing body.

        "about": "The Patent Cooperation Treaty allows for patent protection for an invention simultaneously in a large number of member countries by filing an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153international\u00e2\u20ac\u009d patent application. Such an application may be filed by anyone who is a national or resident of a contracting State. It may generally be filed with the national patent office of the contracting State of which the applicant is a national or resident or, at the applicant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s option, with the International Bureau of WIPO in Geneva. The Treaty regulates in detail the formal requirements with which any international application must comply. Among all the contracting States, the applicant indicates those in which he wishes his international application to have effect (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153designated States\u00e2\u20ac\u009d). The effect of the international application in each designated State is the same as if a national patent application had been filed with the national patent office of that State. The international application is then subjected to an international search, carried out by one of the major patent offices and results in an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153international search report\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, a listing of the citations of published documents that might affect the patentability of the invention claimed in the international application. The international search report is communicated to the applicant who may decide to withdraw his application, in particular where the content of the report suggests that the granting of patents is unlikely, or to amend the claims in the application. If the international application is not withdrawn, it is, together with the international search report, published by the International Bureau and communicated to each designated Office. If the applicant decides to continue with the international application with a view to obtaining national (or regional) patents, he can wait until the end of the 20th month from the priority date (that is, until the end of the 20th month after the filing of the international application or, where that application claims the priority of an earlier application, until the end of the 20th month after the filing of that earlier application), to commence the national procedure before each designated Office by furnishing a translation (where necessary) of the application into the official language of that Office and paying the necessary fees.",
        "relevant": "Member States to the Treaty of Washington permit individuals and companies to more easily patent their inventions in other Member States.  Individuals and companies benefit as well from gains in time and money, the phase of international filing being assured by the national filing office.  The Treaty of Washington allows developing economies to benefit from information concerning patents already filed in foreign countries without having to engage in long and costly research.",
        "aditional": "The Treaty of Washington created the International Patent Cooperation Union, which is composed of an Assembly, an Executive Committee and the International Bureau of WIPO. The present Treaty has been modified several times since its adoption, on 18 September1979, on 3 February 1984 and on 3 October 2001.

The substantive provisions of the Convention fall into three main categories: national treatment, right of priority and common rules.  The Convention mandates that each contracting State must grant the same advantages to nationals of other contracting States as it grants to its own nationals in matters related to industrial property.  The right of priority in the case of patents means that, on the basis of a regular first application filed in one of the contracting States, the applicant may, within a certain period of time apply for protection in any of the other contracting States; these later applications will then be regarded as if they had been filed on the same day as the first application. In other words, these later applications will have priority over applications that may have been filed during the said period of time by other persons for the same invention, utility model, mark or industrial design.",

Phonograms are defined in the Rome Convention as meaning any exclusively aural fixation of sounds of a performance or of other sounds.

Broadcasting organizations enjoy the right to authorize or prohibit certain acts, namely to re-broadcast their broadcasts, to fix and reproduce fixes of their broadcasts, to communicate to the public of their television broadcasts if such communication is made in places accessible to the public against payment of an entrance fee.",

Under the Madrid Protocol a trademark applicant may file an application for international trademark registration, which then takes effect in all State parties to the Protocol. The scope of the Madrid Protocol is similar to the scope of the Agreement, though varying in certain significant aspects. As the 1891 Agreement was not widely accepted, the Protocol addresses the criticised issues. Under the 1891 Agreement, the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153home\u00e2\u20ac\u009d registration of a mark is required before an international application may be made. A trademark applicant must register a mark in his or her own State before seeking registration abroad.  Under the 1989 Protocol, however, an application for international registration can be submitted before an application for national registration is approved.   According to the 1891 Agreement a national registration revocation also results in an international revocation. The 1989 Protocol differs. As five years after issuance an international registration becomes independent of the national registration, an international revocation only occurs if the national registration is cancelled within that time period. Even in the event of a revocation, the 1989 Protocol allows applicants to pursue national registrations in multiple jurisdictions using the original filing date of the international registration.    The present Protocol raises the delay during which a State can refuse to recognize the deposit of a trademark from 12 to 18 months. The renewal period is reduced to 10 years from 20 years, and the application may now be submitted in English or French.",
        "relevant": "An international trademark filing system offers great benefits to a member State.  It makes it easier for national trademark owners to obtain mark protection abroad (one single application in English or French). Therefore, it increases their willingness to do business within member States.  The latter also benefit from a reduced paperwork burden.",
        "aditional": "The ratification of the 1891 Agreement is not required for acceptance of the Protocol.  It is, however, tied to the Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property.  Only member States to that Convention may ratify the Protocol. Inter-governmental Organizations possessing a regional office for the purposes of the registration of trademarks and of which at least one member State has ratified theConvention for Protection of Industrial Property may also become a Party to the Protocol."

An international registration leads to a series of national registrations. In the event that the original registration is revoked or terminated, the international protection is also terminated, even if the reason for cancellation at the national level would not qualify for cancellation under international standards.

It is a basic principle of the Convention, that international sales are regulated by the law chosen by the parties to the contract.  In the event of an absence of choice, the sale is governed by the law of the state where the seller has his place of business at the time of conclusion of the contract.  However, the contract is governed by the law of the state where the buyer has his place of business at the time of conclusion of the contract, if negotiations were conducted and the contract was concluded in that state by and in the presence of the parties, or if the contract provides expressly that the seller must perform his obligation to deliver the goods in that state, or if the contract was concluded on terms determined mainly by the buyer and in response to an invitation directed by the buyer to persons invited to bid.

In addition, the Model Law establishes basic rules of conduct that may serve as guidelines for assessing possible responsibilities and liabilities that might bind upon the various parties involved in the electronic signature process: the signatory, the relying party and trusted third parties that might intervene in the signature process.",

The information presented in the Guide is intended to explain why the provisions in the Model Law have been included as essential minimum features of a modern procurement law.",
        "relevant": "The decision by UNCITRAL to formulate model legislation on procurement was taken in response to the fact that in a number of countries the existing legislation governing procurement is inadequate or outdated. This results in inefficiency and ineffectiveness in the procurement process, patterns of abuse, and the failure of the public purchaser to obtain adequate value in return for the expenditure of public funds. In several countries, a substantial portion of all procurement is channelled through the public sector. Much of such procurement is in connection with projects that are part of the essential process of economic and social development. Those countries in particular suffer from a shortage of public funds to be used for procurement. It is thus critical that procurement be carried out in the most advantageous way possible.  The Model Law may help to remedy disadvantages that stem from the fact that inadequate procurement legislation at the national level creates obstacles to international trade, a significant amount of which is linked to procurement. Disparities among and uncertainty about national legal regimes governing procurement may contribute to limiting the extent to which Governments can access the competitive price and quality benefits available through procurement on an international basis.

        "aditional": "Preparation of a uniform law for the international sale of goods began in 1930 at the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law (UNIDROIT) in Rome. After a long interruption in the work as a result of the Second World War, the draft was submitted to a diplomatic conference in The Hague in 1964, which adopted two conventions, one on the international sale of goods and the other on the formation of contracts for the international sale of goods.  Almost immediately upon the adoption of the two conventions there was widespread criticism of their provisions as reflecting primarily the legal traditions and economic realities of continental Western Europe, which was the region that had most actively contributed to their preparation. As a result, one of the first tasks undertaken by UNCITRAL on its organization in 1968 was to enquire of States whether or not they intended to adhere to those conventions and the reasons for their positions. In the light of the responses received, UNCITRAL decided to study the two conventions to ascertain which modifications might render them capable of wider acceptance by countries of different legal, social and economic systems. The result of this study was the adoption by diplomatic conference on 11 April 1980 of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, which combines the subject matter of the two prior conventions."

The scope of Incoterms is limited to matters relating to the rights and obligations of the parties to the contract of sale with respect to the delivery of goods sold.   Each Incoterm is referred to by a three-letter abbreviation.  Among the best-known Incoterms are EXW (Ex works), FOB (Free on Board), CIF (Cost, Insurance and Freight), DDU (Delivered Duty Unpaid), and CPT (Carriage Paid To).   There are 13 total. Published by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), Incoterms have been the subject of several revisions to reflect developments in international trade.  The ICC introduced the first version of Incoterms in 1936. They have since undergone six revisions (1953, 1967, 1976, 1980, 1990 and 2000). Contracts made after 1 January 2000 refer to the latest edition of Incoterms, which came into force on that date. The correct reference is to \"Incoterms 2000\".",

The Model Law was developed to address the considerable disparities in national laws on arbitration. The need for improvement and harmonization was based on findings that national laws were often inappropriate for international cases. The expectations of parties to an arbitration agreement referring to a chosen set of arbitration rules or an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ad hoc\u00e2\u20ac\u009d arbitration agreement might be frustrated by national laws which affected the parties\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ability to submit future disputes to arbitration, select the arbitrator freely or have the arbitral proceedings conducted according to the agreed rules of procedure and with no more court involvement than appropriate.

It requires courts of contracting States to give effect to an agreement to arbitrate when seized of an action in a matter covered by an arbitration agreement and, in so doing, to refer the parties to arbitration. The Convention's main objective is to ensure that non-domestic arbitral awards are recognized and enforced in the jurisdiction of a contracting State, subject to specific limited exceptions.",
        "relevant": "It provides uniform regime for recognition and enforcement of arbitral agreements and awards and sets out defined grounds for refusal of recognition and enforcement.  Adherence to the Convention helps enhance the confidence of foreign investors in the legal framework of the country, which is perceived as neutral, predictable and transparent. Furthermore, given the great number of States that have already adopted the Convention, adherence enables the country to join a global network of States, which implement international standards, enforce international arbitral awards and respect and support the parties\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 agreement to arbitrate. Finally, joining the Convention implies that awards rendered in the adhering country are guaranteed to be enforceable in all other States parties to the Convention.",
        "aditional": "The Convention was finalised under the auspices of the United Nations Economic and Social Council at a Diplomatic Conference convened in New York in 1958. The Conference adopted the Convention in its Final Act on June 10, 1958. At that time ten nations signed it with a thirteen further nations signing it within the period open for signature. The Convention entered into force after the third ratification, on June 7, 1959. It remains open to accession by any state that is a member of the United Nations or of any of its specialised agencies or by a party to the Statute of the International Court of Justice or by any other State invited toaccede by the General Assembly (Articles VIII and IX). Current contracting States are listed on the UNCITRAL homepage at www.uncitral.org."

MIGA offers political risk insurance (guarantees) to investors and lenders and helps developing countries to attract and retain private investment.  The insurance also covers the risks of currency transfer, expropriation, breach of contract, war, and civil disruption. MIGA also offers member States assistance to improve their regulations and administrative practices to attract and retain investment.",

Projects included the construction of airports, electric grids, telecommunication networks, tourist complexes and others."

The Convention of 1978 envisions two situations: first successions that only concern one part of a territory (when the successor is not a new State), and second successions which lead to the creation of States.  In the first case, treaties concluded by the successor State are extended to the transferred territory to which the treaties of the predecessor applied (principle of automatic extension).  In the second case, the successor state is a non-member state with respect to the treaties of the predecessor.  It cannot, except in particular cases, receive its benefits (principle of intransmissibility).  The provisions of this instrument regulate both bilateral treaties and multilateral treaties.",
        "relevant": "The 1978 Vienna Convention makes it possible to determine which are the obligations which international law imposes on States successors as regards treaties. Many of its provisions are drawn from customary international law.  This convention, initially adopted in order to answer the difficulties caused by the appearance of new States following colonization, has seen its utility reinforced during the recent creation of states following the dissolution of the USSR and that of Yugoslavia.",
        "aditional": "The 1978 Convention is limited to the succession of states in respect of treaties.  The effect of State succession in other matters (property, archives, state debts) is covered by the Convention on Succession of States in respect of State Property, Archives and Debts (Vienna, April 8, 1983)."

Carnet is a standard international customs document for the temporary duty free importation of goods.  The A.T.A. Carnet acts as a guarantee that all customs duties and import taxes will be paid should the item not be re-exported within a mandated time period, at most one year.  As they are an accepted customs document, the amount of import and export paperwork is significantly reduced.  The A.T.A. Carnet also serves as an exemption for taxes normally required in countries of destination or transit. A.T.A. Carnets are used for commercial samples to be demonstrated, the temporary import of professional equipment necessary to perform a task, the import of goods for display or use at exhibitions, fairs or meetings, as well as for goods with an educational, scientific or cultural character.  A.T.A. Carnets specifically cannot be used for perishable products.   National chamber of commerce associations that are approved by Customs are authorized to issue ATA Carnets.  The associations must also be affiliated with an international guaranteeing chain administered by the World Chambers federation headquartered at the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris.",

The carnet is accepted in over 60 countries and saves costs in clearing goods, as well as inspires increased transport across borders.   The A.T.A. can be used by all professions having an international activity (industry, businessmen, artists, sportsmen, etc.).",

This system allows the exportation or importation of a container of the same type or of another container previously imported or exported. Operators maximize efficiency by sharing their containers.

        "about": "The identification of goods is an important element of customs work. Such identification allows for the correct application of customs tariffs and it improves the collection of trade statistics. The Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (HS) is an internationally accepted method for the identification of goods.  The HS establishes an international nomenclature that allows goods to be categorized quickly and accurately.  The harmonized system includes approximately 5000 categories of goods classified by a six-digit code.  The system also contains 21 sections, 97 chapters and 1241 headings at the four-digit level, 930 of which are further divided into sub headings. States that have agreed to the Harmonized System Convention are committed to employing the six-digit system.  They may also use a more detailed classification system with a greater number of digits at the national level.  Goods are classified according to objective criteria that are designed to be precise in their application. The harmonized system is used by States as a foundation for commercial negotiations, the collection of data on international commerce, the control of quotas, and the application of customs tariffs.  It is subject to revisions every four to six years, to reflect changes in both technology and in international trade.",
        "relevant": "The harmonized system is used by nearly 180 countries and is applied to more than 98% of the goods traded worldwide.  It is a valuable tool for the implementation of customs laws.    It reduces costs for both the public and private sector, as countries do not need to invent their own classification system.  Developing countries that adopt this Convention have the possibility to opt for a partial application of the harmonized system, depending upon the specifics of their administrative capacities.  Technical assistance is also offered to adapt their nomenclatures to the harmonized system.",
        "aditional": "Member states of the World Customs Organization may ratify this Convention.  The Harmonized System Committee is responsible for proposing amendments to the Convention and to ensure a uniform application and interpretation of the harmonized system."

It also deals with the designation of routes to be followed within the Contracting States\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 territory; the charges for the use of airport and other facilities related to air transit; and the settlement of disagreements amongst the Contracting Parties.",

In addition, this agreement has more than 120 Contracting Parties, representing an international legal harmonization on international air transit.",
        "aditional": "The present Agreement deals specifically with some aspects of transit rights (rights related to the act of passing through the territory of another State), leaving the actual regulation of international scheduled flights mostly to bilateral agreements. On their part, bilateral air transport agreements establish a regulatory mechanism for the performance of air service between the participating Governments, determining items such as international airline routes, frequency, and capacity.1 In this sense, bilateral agreements constitute an essential instrument of international aviation diplomacy. The privileges stipulated by this agreement are not applicable with respect to airports utilized for military purposes to the exclusion of any scheduled international air services. In addition, the exercise of these privileges should be also in accordance with the provisions of the Convention on International Civil Aviation (also signed in Chicago, 07/12/1944).                                                   1 For many years, Governments used as a model for bilateral air services agreement the bilateral agreement between United States and Great Britain, known as Bermuda I (1949). In 1976, Great Britain renounced the Bermuda I and one year later another bilateral agreement was negotiated, the Bermuda II. Nevertheless, Governments have not resorted to this last agreement as a model. This refusal is justified by its very detailed approach, which specifically deals with the relationship between the United States and Great Britain."

Nevertheless, opposition was raised against the multilateral acceptance of the extensive privileges granted by the other three freedoms. The fifth right in particular, which allows an international airline to operate from one country to the other and then continue to a further country, was bitterly opposed. This fact amounted to a not significant acceptance of this Agreement (the last ratification dates from 1968 by Burundi and the USA withdrew from it in 1946, alleging that commercial value had been granted away by this Agreement). On the other hand, the International Air Services Transit Agreement (also signed in Chicago, 07/12/1944), which includes just the first two privileges, was largely accepted. The privileges are not applicable with respect to airports utilized for military purposes to the exclusion of any scheduled international air services. In addition, the exercise of these privileges should be in accordance with the provisions of the Convention on International Civil Aviation (also signed in Chicago, 07/12/1944). Moreover, the Contracting States accept this Agreement as abrogating all understandings and obligations between them that are inconsistent with its terms. If an airline of any Contracting State enters into any such inconsistent obligations, the State of which it is a national should use its best efforts to secure their termination."

If the operator, his servants or agents can prove that they took all measures that could reasonably be required to avoid the loss or damage, they can not be held accountable. The Convention determines two different limitations of liability according to the mode of transport. As a general rule, the compensation amounts to 8,33 units of account per kilogram of gross weight of the goods lost or damaged (about 12 $US), or 2,75 units of account (about 4 $US), if the goods are handed over to the operator immediately after carriage by sea or by inland waterways, or if they are handed over for such a transport. The operator is not entitled to the benefit of the limitation of liability provided for in this Convention if it is proven that the loss was caused intentionally or recklessly. Any action under this Convention is time-barred if judicial or arbitral proceedings have not been instituted within a period of two years.",

The United Nations Convention on the Carriage of Goods by Sea (Hamburg 31/03/1978), also known as the Hamburg Rules, was intentionally drafted to unify the rules on maritime transport. Nevertheless, the Hamburg Rules did not have substantial adhesion, creating a dual regime of law concerning the carriage of goods by sea, led both by the Hamburg Rules and the Hague Rules, resulting in an on-going disunification of the international maritime law.",
        "aditional": "The 1968 Brussels Protocol, popularly known as the Hague-Visby Rules added and replaced many articles of this Convention. According to this Protocol, the limit of liability for loss or damage amounts to 666.67 Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) per package, approximately 970.00 USD, or 2 SDRs per kilogram, approximately 1.32 USD per pound, whichever is higher. However, there is no liability limit if the carrier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conduct shows intent to cause such loss or damage, or was reckless, knowing that such loss or damage would probably result. Ratification of this Protocol has the effect of accession to the Brussels Convention.  The major differences between the Hamburg Rules and the Hague Rules, amended by the 1968 Brussels Protocol are the following:  Hamburg Rules: Hague Rules, amended by the 1968 Brussels Protocol: . Applies to all contracts for the carriage of goods by sea between two States, except for charter parties. . Applies to contracts for the carriage of goods by sea that are evidenced by a bill of lading. . Liability limit for loss or damage: 835 SDRs (approx. 1,210.00 USD) or 2.5 SDRs per kilogram (approx. 1.65 USD per pound), whichever is higher . Liability for loss of damage: 666.67 SDRs per package (approx. 970.00 USD) or 2 SDRs per kilogram (approx. 1.32 per pound), whichever is higher."

The principle of national treatment is applicable in this regard. The rights established by this Convention do not extend to acts done privately and for non-commercial purposes, or to acts done for experimental purposes, nor to acts done for the purpose of breeding other varieties. No State party may restrict the free exercise of a breeder's right for reasons other than public interest and only in exchange for fair remuneration. Any breeder, who has filed an application for the protection of a variety in one of the State parties, enjoys for the purpose of filing an application for the grant of a breeder's right for the same variety with the authority of any other State party, the right of priority for a period of twelve months.",

The Convention creates an intergovernmental organization with international legal personality, the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants, which is headquartered in Geneva and composed of a Council and a Bureau."

This change involved two elements: the increased use of payment orders sent by electronic means rather than on paper, and the shift from the generalized use of debit transfers to the generalized use of credit transfers. One result was that previous efforts to unify the law governing international debit transfers were not relevant to the new funds transfer techniques. The Model Law offers the opportunity to unify the law of credit transfers by enacting a text that is drafted to meet the needs of modern funds transfer techniques.",

They entered into force on 13 October 1989. - 1989 Amendments (London, 19/01/1989): These amendments enabled Inmarsat to provide services to landbased vehicles as well as ships and aircraft. They entered into force on 26 June 1997. - 1994 Amendments (London, 09/12/1994): One of these amendments modified the official name of Inmarsart from International Maritime Satellite Organization to the International Mobile Satellite Organization, still abbreviated as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcInmarsat.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 This modification is a result of the structural changes that have occurred in the Organization since it was created, mainly regarding the extension of its services from the maritime sector to other modes of transport. There were also changes regarding the composition of the Inmarsat Council. These amendments are not yet in force. - 1998 Amendments (London, 24/04/1998): In 1998, Inmarsat's Assembly of member Governments agreed to privatize Inmarsat from April 1999. The new structure comprises two entities: Inmarsat Plc., a public limited company which forms the commercial arm of Inmarsat and the International Mobile Satellite Organization (IMSO), an intergovernmental body established to ensure that Inmarsat continues to meet its public service obligations, including obligations relating to the Global Maritime Distress Safety System (GMDSS). IMSO replaces Inmarsat as observer at IMO meetings. These amendments entered into force on 31 July 2001."

It examines the status of earnings generated by a person physically or morally residing abroad.

The taxation rate must be reasonable and non discriminatory, and a portion of the revenue must be paid to the State of residence.",

Therefore, the sales price must reflect the real value of the resource and exported tropical timbers must be from forests run by sustainable management practices. A special fund assists producing countries to undertake the reforms and investments necessary to carry out sustainable management of timber resources. The 1994 Agreement does not address other reasons for deforestation, such as voluntary or accidental fires or the overuse of woods for domestic purposes.",
        "relevant": "By ratifying the International Tropical Timber Agreement, timber-producing countries have access to funds for the sustainable management of tropical forests. The funds are intended to help countries to administer their timber resources in a sustainable and ecologically sound manner. All projects are funded by voluntary contributions, mostly from consuming member countries. From 1987 to 2005, ITTO has funded more than 600 projects, pre-projects and activities valued at more than US$250 million. In addition, States party to the Agreement develop internationally agreed policy documents to promote sustainable forest management and forest conservation and assist tropical member countries to adapt such policies to local circumstances. An equal partnership in decision-making, policy formulation and project development between producing members (tropical developing countries) and tropical timber consuming members (mostly temperate developed countries) characterizes the Agreement.",
        "aditional": "The International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO), created by the former Agreement and headquartered in Yokoyama, Japan, provides a forum where producing and consuming countries and interested non-governmental organizations can meet.  The highest authority of the Organization is the International Tropical Timber Council, exercising regulatory powers, which is composed of all the Organization\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s members. ITTO has two categories of membership: producing members and consuming members. Annual contributions and votes are distributed equally between these two groups, which are called caucuses. Within each caucus, the votes of individual members are calculated according to tropical timber trade and, in the case of producers, also on the extent of tropical forests within the country."

By applying the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153precautionary principle\u00e2\u20ac\u009d on an international level, the Cartagena Protocol enables State Parties to ban the import of genetically modified organisms even if no scientific evidence exists of them causing harm for people or nature. To ensure transparency of transboundary movement of genetically modified organisms, the Protocol ties these to a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Prior Informed Consent\u00e2\u20ac\u009d procedure. The exporting country has to precisely inform the importing country on technical elements allowing for risk assessment and risk management. While an import authorization is given, the traceability of the product has to be ensured by proper labelling.  The Protocol establishes a Biosafety Clearinghouse, located in Montreal, in charge of the distribution of information on modified organisms and the registration of State Parties having approved the import or release of such organisms. The provisions of the 2000 Cartagena Protocol do not apply to pharmaceutical products intended for human use, or to the contained use of genetically modified organisms. It applies to modified organisms intended for direct use as food, feed or agricultural seeds.",
        "relevant": "By regulating transboundary movements of living modified organisms, the 2000 Cartagena Protocol offers more transparency and promotes a strong cooperation on this subject among developed and developing economies. It allows developing countries to assess the hazards of genetically modified organisms, without banning them. It provides legal grounds for refusing import and use of modified organisms in order to avoid that a Member State\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s territory is used without prior consent for breeding experiments with genetically modified organisms.",

This 2001 Convention requires the registered owner of a ship having a gross tonnage greater than 1000 and registered in a State Party to maintain insurance or other financial security (such as the guarantee of a bank or similar financial institution) to cover liability for pollution damage in an amount equal to the limits of liability under the applicable national or international limitation regime, but in all cases, not exceeding an amount calculated in accordance with the Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims (London, 19 November 1976).

This plan requires masters or other persons being in charge of ships flying its flag and persons having charge of offshore units under its jurisdiction to report without delay any event on their ship or offshore unit involving a discharge or probable discharge of oil. Each Party shall establish a national system for a prompt and effective response to oil pollution incidents. The minimum requirement for this system includes the designation of the competent national authority or authorities responsible for oil pollution preparedness; a national operational contact point or points, responsible for the receipt and transmission of oil pollution reports and an authority entitled to act on behalf of the State to request assistance or to decide to render the assistance requested. It further requires a national contingency plan for preparedness and response including the organizational relationship of the various bodies involved, whether public or private, taking into account guidelines developed by the Organization.

The Convention establishes a list of waste for which dumping is prohibited, (including mercury, crude oil, radioactive waste, etc.) and requires a specific permit for some materials (arsenic, lead, copper, zinc, pesticides).  All other wastes can be dumped under a general permit.  Each Contracting Party designates an appropriate authority or authorities to issue general permits. The present Convention does not cover ship waste or waste resulting from the exploitation of the seabed, nor does it cover waste dumped in internal waters of State parties.   State parties are required to incorporate the provisions of the 1972 Convention into their national laws. This instrument has been amended on five occasions: - The two Amendments of 12 October 1978 prohibit the incineration of trash in the sea and institute new procedures for dispute settlement under the 1972 Convention; - The Amendment of 24 September 1980 lists the substances that require a special permit; - The Amendment of 3 November 1989 address rules related to the issuance of a dumping permit; - The Amendment of 12 November 1993 prohibits the dumping of radioactive waste; - The London Protocol adopted on 8 November 1996 is a re-write of the original text and may substitute itself for the 1972 Convention.",

The export of wastes to non-party States for incinerations is also prohibited.  Exceptionally, if provided with a proper permit, a State can dump certain items, including dredged material, sewage sludge, fish waste, or material resulting from industrial fish processing operations, vessels and platforms or other man-made structures at sea, inert, inorganic geological material and organic material of natural origin. Contrary to the London Convention of 29 December 1972, the 1996 Protocol addresses the dumping of wastes in the internal waters of State parties.  The Protocol of 1996 also adds the principle of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153polluter payer\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, ensuring that individuals or entities authorized to dump wastes and other noxious substances are required to assume the costs linked to pollution created by their actions.",

The Convention of 1969 recognizes the right of all State parties to take necessary measures to prevent, mitigate or eliminate maritime pollution.   This right of intervention is nevertheless subject to established procedures to ensure that coastal States does not compromise the interests of individuals or corporate entities, or other States.  Before taking any measures, a coastal State must proceed with consultations with other States affected by the maritime casualty, particularly with the flag State or States.   The coastal State must also notify without delay the proposed measures to any persons physical or corporate known to the coastal State to have interests which can reasonably be expected to be affected by those measures. Additionally, the coastal State shall take into account any views they may submit.  The coastal State may also proceed to a consultation with independent experts, whose names shall be chosen from a list maintained by the International Maritime Organization.  Measures taken by the coastal State shall be proportionate to the damage actual or threatened to it. The provisions of the Convention of 1969 do not apply to warships or to ships used in non-commercial government service.   The 1973 Protocol extends the provisions of the 1969 Convention to substances other than oil (such as chemical products, liquefied gas and radioactive materials).

        "about": "This Convention guarantees that adequate compensation is available to persons who suffer oil pollution damage resulting from maritime casualties involving oil-carrying ships.  The owner of a ship at the time of an incident, or where the incident consists of a series of occurrences at the time of the first such occurrence, is held liable for any pollution damage caused by oil which has escaped or been discharged from the ship as a result of the incident.   This is a no fault liability.  This Convention also standardizes the rules regarding procedure and responsibility.   The Convention requires ships covered by it to maintain insurance or other financial security in sums equivalent to the owner's total liability for one incident. It applies to all seagoing vessels actually carrying oil in bulk as cargo, but only ships carrying more than 2,000 tons of oil are required to maintain insurance in respect of oil pollution damage.  The owner of a ship may limit his liability to a maximum of 18 million US dollars. The provisions of the 1969 Convention do not apply to warships or to ships used in non-commercial government service.  The Protocol adopted on 9 November 1976 introduced a new unit of measure to calculate liability using Special Drawing Rights.  The Protocol of 27 November 1992 and the amendments of 18 October 2000 revise the compensation offered to victims of oil pollution damage (up to 115 million dollars depending upon the size of the ship).",
        "relevant": "State parties to the Convention of 1969 allow their population affected by an oil spill to avoid long and complex legal procedures.  Funds so paid can also serve to partially compensate losses caused by the pollution and earnings losses in fishing and tourism. This instrument equally requires owners of ships to maintain insurance so as to be covered in case of pollution caused by their ships.",
        "aditional": "This Convention is supplemented by the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage and by its Protocol of 27 November 1992 that requires increased compensation to victims of oil spill pollutions. In 2003, 43 States, representing 48% of world tonnage, ratified the Convention of 1969."

The allocated compensation can reach as much as 82 million US dollars.   Since its entry into force, the present Convention has been amended several times. A Protocol adopted on 19 November 1976 introduces Special Drawing Rights, a new unit of measure as a basis for calculating compensation.  The Protocol of 25 May 1984 raises the ceiling of compensation. The Protocol of 27 November 1992 aims to replace the Convention of 1971 by creating a new compensation fund (FUND 2), offering an indemnisation up to 256 million US dollars.  State parties to the Protocol of 1992 cease to be a party to the 1971 Convention.  The amendments of 18 October 2000 and the Protocol of 16 May 2003 also revise the amount of compensation offered to victims of oil spills up to 291 million US dollars.",

Amendments to this Convention may be adopted by Governments or by IMO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Maritime Safety Committee.

The 1995 amendments, which entered into force on 1 February 1997, are the most important ones. They completely revised the Convention bringing it up to date. They divided the annex of the Convention into regulations, establishing a new STCW code. This code is divided in Part A and B. Part A is mandatory and covers the minimum standards of competence required for seagoing personnel. Part B is recommended and deals with guidance intended to help Parties implement the Convention. These amendments also brought some innovations to the Convention mainly as concerns assurance of compliance with the Convention."

States ratifying this instrument must accept Annexes I and II, but can choose not to ratify the others. It currently includes six technical annexes, the first two of which deal specifically with:    - Annex I: Prevention of pollution by oil. It establishes detailed oil discharge criteria and it introduces and defines the concept of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcspecial areas\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, which are considered to be so vulnerable to pollution by oil that oil discharges within them have been completely prohibited. (Entry into force: 02/10/1983) - Annex II: Control of pollution by noxious liquid substances in bulk, detailing the discharge criteria and control measures. (Entry into force: 06/04/1987).",

Violations to this instrument within the jurisdiction of any party are punishable either under the law of the party or under the law of the flag State. The Contracting parties accept the obligation to promote support to those parties which request technical assistance for various purposes, such as training, the supply of equipment, research, and combating pollution.

It replaces the fault-based liability system with a strict liability system (no-fault liability), establishing the limits of strict liability to 250,000 SDR per passenger, approximately 325,000 USD. If the loss exceeds the limit the carrier is further liable up to a limit of 400,000 SDR per passenger, approximately 524,000 USD, unless the carrier proves that the incident which caused the loss occurred without the fault or neglect of the carrier. Moreover, the 2002 Protocol introduces compulsory insurance to cover passengers on ships, requiring carriers to maintain insurance or other financial security to cover the limits of strict liability (no-fault liability) under the Convention. Such limit should not be less than 250,000 SDR, approximately 325,000 USD, per passenger. This Protocol will enter into force 12 months after being accepted by 10 States."

The Treaty is applicable to national and regional patent requests made with the filing office of a contracting party.  It applies equally to patent requests made during the national phase of the Patent Cooperation Treaty (Washington, 19 June 1970). The provisions of the Patent Law Treaty address six major points:  - The simplification of filing date determinations; - The use of standardized forms for registering and maintaining a patent; - The possibility for holders of a patent to undertake administrative formalities without the necessity of an intermediary; - The simplification of procedures related to the transfer of ownership of a patent; - A reduction in the possibility for loss of patent rights due to unintentional non-observation of certain conditions related to a filing; - The encouragement of electronic filing of a patent without excluding the filings carried out in a written format.",
        "relevant": "The implementation of simplified and uniform procedures permits the reduction of costs connected to patent filing and minimizes the risks of error that may occur during registration.",
        "aditional": "The Patent Law Treaty creates an Assembly representing the State parties. The International Bureau of WIPO is responsible for the administrative tasks.  All State parties to the Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property (Paris, 20 March 1883) or members of WIPO may become a party to this Convention. Under certain conditions intergovernmental organisations may also adhere."

Under the Vienna classification, a mark is examined for its figurative elements.  These elements are then categorized, first broadly (such as human beings), then in specific divisions (men) and finally in even further revised sections (sailors).  A code is then assigned.  There are 29 categories, 144 divisions, 775 main sections and 1112 auxiliary sections. State parties are required to detail these marks in their official publications of mark renewal and classification.   The Vienna Agreement has a technical character and is not concerned with trademark protection.",

This procedure simplifies trademark searches and eliminates re-classification work when documents are exchanged at the international level.

There are approximately 10000 indicators referring to goods and 1000 referring to services. The Nice classifications are continually revised and updated, a task undertaken by the Committee of Experts, which was created by the Treaty.   State parties to the Nice Agreement are required to apply the Nice classification when classifying marks.  This registration can either be the principle classification or a secondary one, but it must occur. The usage of the Nice classification is also required for the international registration of marks under the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Madrid System\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.",

The principles are non-binding guidelines, and are not presented in the form of a treaty or convention. The Principles are composed of a Preamble and 119 articles divided into seven chapters, namely \"General Provisions\" (Chapter 1); \"Formation\" (Chapter 2); \"Validity\" (Chapter 3); \"Interpretation\" (Chapter 4); \"Content\" (Chapter 5); \"Performance\" (Chapter 6) and \"Non-Performance\" (Chapter 7). Chapter 6 has two sections dealing with \"Performance in General\" and \"Hardship\" respectively. Chapter 7 has four sections, namely one concerning \"Non-Performance in General\", one on the \"Right to Performance\", one on \"Termination\", and one on \"Damages\".  The provisions (\"black-letter rules\") are accompanied by detailed comments, including illustrations, which form an integral part of the Principles. They have been translated into 16 languages (Arabic, Chinese, Czech, Dutch, English, Farsi, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Spanish and Vietnamese).",
        "relevant": "These Principles are of interest to those who engage in international trade, as well as legislators and judges.  As they represent a system of rules of contract law that are common to existing national legal systems, traders can benefit from the understanding of the exact terms of a contract.  The principles can also provide basis for a private or public arbitral decision.  They can as well serve as a foundation point for new national contract legislation.",

Thousands of copies have been sold to law offices and business lawyers, and numerous legal decisions have made reference to their terms. In April 1999, the Governing Council added a model clause to the Principles that parties may use to ensure that their agreement is governed by the UNIDROIT Principles."

These plurilateral agreements are not binding upon all members of the WTO, but rather just those that agree to ratify it.  The Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) is one of these agreements. Its purpose is to open up as much procurement as possible to international competition. It is designed to make laws, regulations, procedures and practices regarding government procurement more transparent and to ensure they do not protect domestic products or suppliers, or discriminate against foreign products or suppliers. It also reinforces rules guaranteeing fair and non-discriminatory conditions of international competition.  The agreement has two elements \u00e2\u20ac\u201d general rules and obligations, and schedules of national entities in each member country whose procurement is subject to the agreement. A large part of the general rules and obligations concern tendering procedures. The Agreement applies to contracts worth more than specified threshold values. For central government purchases of goods and services, the threshold is SDR 130,000 (some $185,000 in June 2003). For purchases of goods and services by sub-central government entities the threshold varies but is generally in the region of SDR 200,000. For utilities, thresholds for goods and services is generally in the area of SDR 400,000 and for construction contracts, in general the threshold value is SDR 5,000,000. Developing countries and least developed countries benefit from special procedures related to their needs.",

Following the entry into force of the present Convention, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) was established. This Commission is responsible for studying the populations of tuna and tuna-like fishes and such other species of fishes exploited in tuna fishing.  Headquartered in Madrid, it is required to conduct scientific research and appraise information concerning measures and methods to ensure maintenance of the populations of tuna and tuna-like fishes in the Convention area. All recommendations made by the Commission become effective for State parties six months after their date of notification, though objections may be made.",

Its adoption supersedes the four Geneva Conventions of 1958, (Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone, Convention on the Continental Shelf, Convention on the High Seas, and the Convention of the Living Resources of the High Seas).  There are two implementation agreements related to this Convention.  In 1994, an Agreement on the Implementation of Part XI of the Convention was proposed by the UN General Assembly to address certain difficulties with the seabed mining provisions.  In 1995, the Agreement for the Implementation of the Law of the Sea Convention relating to the Management and Conservation of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks was adopted, which set out principles for fish conservation and management and established that such management must be based on the precautionary approach.",

        "about": "The Codex Alimentarius Commission was created in 1963 by FAO and WHO to develop food standards, guidelines and related texts such as codes of practice under the Joint FAO/WHO Food Standards Programme. The main purposes of this Programme are protecting health of the consumers, ensuring fair trade practices in the food trade and promoting coordination of all food standards work undertaken by international governmental and non-governmental organizations. The Codex Alimentarius contains more than 200 standards in the prescribed format for individual foods or groups of foods. In addition, it includes the General Standard for the Labelling of Pre-packaged Foods, the Codex General Guidelines on Claims and the Codex Guidelines on Nutrition Labelling, all of which are aimed at ensuring honest practices in the sale of food while also providing guidance to consumers in their choice of products. Other general standards for food hygiene, food additives, contaminants or toxins in food and for irradiated foods are of major importance in protecting consumers' health and they are valued widely for this purpose. Similarly, maximum residue limits for pesticides and veterinary drugs and maximum limits for food additives and contaminants have been established to ensure that consumers are not exposed to unsafe levels of hazardous materials.",
        "relevant": "The Codex Alimentarius Commission provides a forum for all participating States to discuss and present Codex-related issues. Particularly developing countries should take advantage of this forum to promote their point of views and ensure fair trade practices, as the influence of the Codex extends to every continent. Membership is open to all Member Nations and Associate Members of FAO/WHO.  A principal concern of national governments is that food imported from other countries should be safe and not jeopardize the health of consumers or pose a threat to the health and safety of their animal and plant populations. Consequently, governments of importing countries have introduced mandatory laws and regulations to eliminate or minimize such threats. In the area of food, animal and plant control, these measures could lead to the creation of barriers to international food trade. The adoption of Codex standards as scientifically justified norms is of immense significance. The standards have become an integral part of a legal framework facilitating international trade through harmonization and they have been used as benchmark in international trade disputes. Since the 1994 Uruguay Round Agreements on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS) and Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT), both encouraging the international harmonization of food standards, the Codex Alimentarius has gained further importance. Thereagreements encourage Member States to the World Trade Organization to apply the rules of the Codex Alimentarius. While the growing world interest in all Codex activities clearly indicates global acceptance of the Codex philosophy - embracing harmonization, consumer protection and facilitation of international trade - in practice it is difficult for many countries to accept Codex standards in the statutory sense. Differing legal formats and administrative systems, varying political systems and sometimes the influence of national attitudes and concepts of sovereign rights impede the progress of harmonization and deter the acceptance of Codex standards. Despite these difficulties, however, the process of harmonization is gaining impetus by virtue of the strong international desire to facilitate trade.",

The Convention also requires countries to adopt provisions criminalizing certain forms of conduct, such as bribery, embezzlement and money laundering. An important part of the Convention is dedicated to fostering international cooperation with specific measures such as extradition and mutual legal assistance.  An entirely new set of rules and measures relates to asset recovery.  Finally, the convention includes measures on technical cooperation to strengthen the capacity of developing countries in implementing its provisions.",

State parties agree to prohibit the production, manufacture, export and import, trade in, possession or use of any such drugs, except for amounts necessary for medical and scientific research.   They also agree cooperate internationally in order to accomplish their goals. The International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) investigates failures to fulfil the requirements of the Convention.   The Board ensures availability of adequate supplies for medical and scientific use and prevents leakages from licit sources to illicit traffic. To this end, it administers an estimates system for narcotic drugs and a voluntary assessment system for psychotropic substances and monitors international trade in drugs through the statistical returns system. The Board also monitors government control over chemicals used in the illicit manufacture of drugs and assists in preventing diversion of these chemicals into illicit traffic. It also identifies existing weaknesses in the national and international control systems and contributes to correcting the situation. Further, the Board is responsible for assessing chemicals used to illicitly manufacture drugs for possible international control.

To accomplish this, the INCB directly monitors the production, trade and sale of psychotropic substances.

The Board also maintains a permanent dialogue with Governments to assist them in complying with their obligations under the international drug control treaties and, to that end, recommends, where appropriate, technical or financial assistance to be provided.

This results in a multitude of regulations being applied to temporary import matters.",

When part of the territory of a State is transferred by that State to another State, the passing of the State debt is to be settled by agreement.   In the absence of such an agreement, the State debt of the predecessor State passes to the successor State in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153equitable proportion\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, taking into account the property, rights and interests which pass to the successor State in relation to that State debt.",

The multimodal transport document accredits for the receipt of the goods as described in the document. The responsibility of the multimodal transport operator for the goods under this Convention covers the period from the time he takes goods in his charge to the time of their delivery. He assumes liability due to loss of, damage to or delay in delivery of the goods, unless he proves that he or his agents have taken every measure of precaution to avoid the damage. His liability is limited to an amount not exceeding 920 units of account per package (about $US 1,330) or 2.75 units of account per kilogram of gross weight (about $US 4) of the goods lost or damaged, whichever is the higher. The operator is not entitled to the benefit of the limitation of liability provided for in this Convention if it is proven that the loss was caused intentionally or recklessly. Any action under this Convention is time-barred if judicial or arbitral proceedings have not been instituted within a period of two years from the moment of delivery or loss of the goods.",

The General Assembly adopted three UN Resolutions stating general rules on the law of outer space: - Resolution 1962 on the declaration of legal principles governing the activities of States in the exploration and use of outer space (13 December 1963); - Resolution 1884 calling upon States from placing in orbit around the earth any objects carrying nuclear weapons or any other kind of weapons of mass destruction or from installing such weapons on celestial bodies (17 October 1963);  - Resolution 110 condemning propaganda designed or likely to provoke or encourage any threat to the peace, breach of the peace or act of aggression (3 November 1947).  The conclusion of multilateral treaties has become the principal means of enacting pertinent legal rules. Considering the fundamental statements of the Resolutions and desiring to contribute to the development of mutual understanding and to the strengthening of friendly relations between States and peoples, the Treaty governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon and other Celestial Bodies (Outer Space Treaty) affirms the freedom of exploration and use of outer space and prohibits all claims of sovereignty. It also proscribes the establishment of military bases, installations or fortifications on celestial bodies and the placement in orbit around the earth of objects carrying weapons of mass destruction. It constitutes a legal hindrance to the installation of nuclear explosives in space. Carriage of weapons through space and exploration by artificial satellites remain authorized.",
        "relevant": "The Outer Space Treaty provides the basis for all subsequent treaties and other legal instruments relating to space activities. The exploration and use of outer space is a global problem affecting the entire international community. Recognizes this fact, the Treaty stresses \"the common interest of all mankind\" in the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes. This provision provides sufficient legal grounds for claims to full and effective participation by all members of the internationalcommunity in the decision-making process relating to outer space. Consequently real progress in the development of legal norms applicable to the use and exploration of outer space can only be made when as many states as possible, including all states having the capability to engage in outer space activities, are actively in agreement.",

A launching State has the absolute liability to pay compensation for damage caused by its space object on the surface of the earth or to aircraft in flight, whereas damage implies loss of life, personal injury and the loss of or damage to personal property. In the event of damage being caused elsewhere than on the surface of the earth to a space object of a launching State by a space object of another launching State, the liability of the latter is engaged if the damage is due to its fault. A claim for compensation for damage has to be presented to a launching State through diplomatic channels. If a State does not maintain diplomatic relations with the launching State concerned, its claim may be presented through a third State or the Secretary General of the United Nations. The provisions of the Convention do not apply to damage caused by a space object of a launching State to nationals of that State, neither to foreign nationals participating in the operation of the damaging space object, nor to guests invited to the launching or recovery area. Two or more States engaging commonly to launch an object into space are jointly liable for all resulting damages.",

The 15 April Agreement is the one that creates the World Trade Organization (WTO). Its structure is headed by a Ministerial Conference meeting at least once every two years. A General Council oversees the operation of the agreement and ministerial decisions on a regular basis and establishes subsidiary bodies such as the Goods Council, the Services Council and the Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) Council. The WTO Agreement also establishes a Dispute Settlement Body (DSB). The WTO Agreement has four (4) main objectives: to improve access to goods and market services, to reinforce the system of existing international commercial rules, to ensure world trade stability, predictability and transparency and finally to improve the commercial disputes settlement mechanism.",
        "relevant": "This agreement is critically relevant because it provides for a common institutional framework, including the GATT agreements as well as those resulting from the Uruguay round. Thus, it provides a greater visibility of international Trade Rules. This visibility is increased by the creation of the WTO as a Multilateral Commercial Institution that has authority for all trade-related questions such as trade in services, agriculture, intellectual property and trade dispute settlement.",
        "aditional": "Typically, WTO agreements focus on the situation of developing countries by creating exceptions that allow them more favorable rules."

The Member States to the present Protocol recognized that certain grounds of jurisdiction not included in the provisions of the Convention, exceptionally justify the international recognition and enforcement of judgements.  These grounds are based on the presence in the territory of the State of origin of property belonging to the defendant, on the nationality or domicile of the plaintiff, the fact that the defendant carried on business within the territory of the State of origin, service of a writ upon the defendant or the unilateral specification of the forum by the plaintiff, particularly in an invoice. The Protocol applies to all foreign decisions rendered within the scope of the 1971 Convention, regardless of their State of origin and directed against a person having his domicile or habitual residence in a Member State.",

The Nineteenth Hague Conference reconfirmed the great importance of harmonising the rules on jurisdiction and recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters on a worldwide basis and in 2002 established a working group on a future \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Judgements Convention\u00e2\u20ac\u009d."

If the parties to a contract of international sale expressly designate in writing a court of one of the Contracting States as having jurisdiction to adjudicate disputes that have arisen or may arise, the designated court has exclusive jurisdiction and any other court has to declare itself incompetent. However, if a defendant appears before a court of one of the Contracting States which has no jurisdiction on account of the designation of a forum, but its own laws assume jurisdiction, the defendant has to accept the jurisdiction of this court unless he contests it. A judgement rendered in one of the Contracting States by any court with jurisdiction according to the provisions of the present Convention, has to be recognized and declared executory, without review of the merits under the condition that the judgement was rendered under due process of law.",

The legislative recommendations and the model provisions consist of a set of core provisions dealing with matters that deserve attention in legislation specifically concerned with privately financed infrastructure projects. The model provisions are designed to be implemented and supplemented by the issuance of regulations providing further details. Areas more suitably addressed by regulations rather than statutes are identified accordingly.

Where it judges that a draft Convention reflects a consensus as between the States which have participated in the study committee, the Governing Council calls for a diplomatic Conference for its adoption.

        "relevant": "By adhering to UNIDROIT, States can participate in the process of drafting and adopting multilateral trade treaties, model laws and legal guides in the field of commercial law. Full participation in UNIDROIT committees of governmental experts is only open to representatives of UNIDROIT member States. Where commercial transactions tend to be transnational by their very nature, harmonised rules and widely accepted legal solutions help international trade. UNIDROIT's basic statutory objective is to prepare modern and harmonised uniform rules of private law. UNIDROIT is mainly concerned with substantive rules of law, in important commercial areas such as the international sale of goods, international contracts, international financial leasing, international factoring, etc.",
        "aditional": "The Secretariat may invite other States, International Organisations and professional associations to participate in UNIDROIT committees of governmental experts as observers, in light of the subject matter concerned.  In addition, UNIDROIT maintains close ties with International Organisations, both intergovernmental and non-governmental, which in many cases take the form of co-operation agreements concluded at inter-Secretariat level."

Furthermore, in the Court scrutiny process of arbitral awards, any legal problem relating to the enforcement of a foreign arbitral award in a given country would usually be examined by the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153national member\u00e2\u20ac\u009d concerned, thereby facilitating the recognition of foreign arbitral awards in his/her country.",

The General Assembly gave the Commission the general mandate to further the progressive harmonization and unification of the law of international trade.  In addition, the Commission pursues the codification and wider acceptance of international trade terms, provisions, customs and practices, in collaboration, where appropriate, with the organizations operating in this field. The Commission is composed of sixty member States elected by the General Assembly. Membership is structured so as to be representative of the world's various geographic regions and its principal economic and legal systems. Members of the Commission are elected for terms of six years, the terms of half of them expiring every three years.

When a commercial product is developed using these resources, farmers, plant breeders and research institutions have to pay an equitable share of the resulting monetary benefit, if this product is not made available to other potential users for further research and breeding. If the commercial product is freely available, the payment is voluntary. Funds arisen out of the System will be equally shared in order to finance projects aimed at farmers in developing countries and countries with economy in transition, who conserve plant genetic resources for food and agriculture.

It is an International Organization \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one of the United Nations\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 specialized agencies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that pursues the goal of fighting poverty.  The Bank provides loans at preferential rates and grants to countries that face serious economic problems. IBRD is one of the highest rated borrowers in international markets, and is able to borrow at relatively low interest rates. In addition, some 40 rich countries provide money for this funding by making contributions every four years.",

The Loan Agreement governs the legal relations between the Borrower and the Bank. Its provisions, which concern international bids as well as other financing instruments (national competitive bidding, shopping, direct contracting, procurement) aim to ensure that any money borrowed from the Bank is directed towards the purpose for which it was intended. The acceptance of these directives is essential for States which desire to borrow from IBRD."

        "about": "The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is a network of national standards institutes (one member per country) with a Central Secretariat in Geneva, Switzerland, that coordinates the system.  ISO is a non-governmental organization. The most representative national body of standardization in a given country can become an ISO member. Full members \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Member bodies\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have one vote, notwithstanding the size of the economy of the country in which they are based. ISO has two additional categories of membership: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153correspondent Members\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \u00e2\u20ac\u201c institutes in countries which do not yet have a fully developed national standards activity, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153subscriber Members\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \u00e2\u20ac\u201c institutes from countries with very small economies that nevertheless wish to maintain contact with international standardization. They pay reduced membership fees. Although such members do not have a vote, they can remain up to date on standardization developments.  ISO is the world's largest developer of international standards. Since its establishment in 1947, it has published more than 13 700 International Standards. ISO standards are technical agreements providing the framework for compatible technology worldwide. International standards play a key role in improving efficiency of production and facilitating international trade. International Standards create \"a level playing field\" for all competitors on international markets. The existence of divergent national or regional standards can create technical barriers to trade, even when restrictive import quotas and tariffs have been reduced.  ISO standards are voluntary. As a non-governmental organization, ISO has no legal authority to enforce their implementation. However, several ISO standards \u00e2\u20ac\u201c mainly those concerned with health, safety or the environment \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have been adopted in some countries as part of their regulatory framework. ISO standards are reviewed at least every five years to decide whether they should be maintained, updated or withdrawn.",
        "relevant": "Every ISO member has the right to take part in the development of any standard which it judges to be important to its country's economy. Each country is on an equal footing to influence the direction of ISO's work at the strategic level, as well as the technical content of its individual standards.  Developing economies in particular can benefit from ISO standards. ISO standards are an important means both of acquiring technological know-how that is backed by international consensus, and of raising their capability to export and compete on global markets.",
        "aditional": "ISO \u00e2\u20ac\u201c along with IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) and ITU (International Telecommunication Union) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has built a strategic partnership with the WTO (World Trade Organization) with the common goal of promoting a free and fair global trading system. The political agreements reached within the framework of the WTO require underpinning by technical agreements.  In addition, the WTO's Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) includes the Code of Good Practice for the Preparation, Adoption and Application of Standards. The TBT Agreement recognizes the important contribution that international standards and conformity assessment systems can make to improving efficiency of production and facilitating international trade. Therefore, where International Standards exist or their completion is imminent, the Code states that standardizing bodies should use them as a basis for standards they develop. The Code requires that standardizing bodies that have accepted its terms notify this fact to the ISO/IEC Information Centre located at the ISO Central Secretariat. Standardizing bodies having accepted the Code must publish their work programmes and also notify the existence of their work programmes to the ISO/IEC Information Centre.  On behalf of the WTO, ISO periodically publishes a directory of standardizing bodies that have accepted the WTO TBT Standards Code."

        "about": "The International Organization of Legal Metrology (OIML) is an intergovernmental organization established in 1955 in order to promote the global harmonization of legal metrology procedures. Legal metrology refers to the legislative, administrative and technical procedures established by, or by reference to, public authorities and implemented on their behalf in order to specify and to ensure, in a regulatory or contractual manner, the appropriate quality and credibility of measurements related to official controls, trade, health, safety and the environment.  OIML membership includes Members States, countries which participate actively in technical activities, and Corresponding Members, countries which join the OIML as observers.  The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bureau International de M\u00c3\u00a9trologie L\u00c3\u00a9gale\u00e2\u20ac\u009d (BIML) is the Secretariat and headquarters of the OIML, ensuring both the Organization\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s day-to-day administration and the planning of longer-term actions.  Since 1955, the OIML has developed a worldwide technical structure that provides its Members with guidelines for the elaboration of national and regional requirements concerning the manufacturing and use of measuring instruments for legal metrology applications. In particular, OIML introduced in 1991 the Certificate System for Measuring Instruments. The system provides the possibility for a manufacturer to obtain an OIML Certificate and a Test Report indicating that a given instrument type (pattern) complies with the requirements of the relevant OIML international recommendations. Certificates are delivered by OIML Member States that have established one or several issuing authorities responsible for processing applications. OIML certificates are accepted by national metrology services on a voluntary basis. Given the increasing national implementation of OIML guidelines, more and more manufacturers are referring to OIML international recommendations to ensure that their products meet international specifications for metrological performance and testing.",
        "relevant": "By becoming a member of OIML, countries participate in the process of shaping model regulations in the field of legal metrology. OIML draft recommendations and documents are developed by Technical Committees or Subcommittees which are formed by the OIML Member States.  In addition, the Certificate System for Measuring Instruments facilitates the administrative procedures associated with the international trade of measuring instruments subject to legal requirements. The OIML web site database lists those OIML Certificates registered by the BIML, and gives the list of categories of instruments covered by the System, the addresses of issuing authorities in OIML Member States, and those of recipients of Certificates (applicants and manufacturers).",

Securities are defined by the Convention as any shares, bonds or other financial instruments or financial assets (other than cash), or any interest therein. The traditional conflict of laws rule for determining the enforceability of a transfer or pledge of securities is based on the lex rei sitae principle (the validity of the disposition is determined by the law of the place where the securities are located). In order to address the legal and practical problems arising from the application of this approach in the modern context of indirectly held securities transactions, the Convention adopted the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Place of the Relevant Intermediary Approach\u00e2\u20ac\u009d (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153PRIMA\u00e2\u20ac\u009d), which has found favour around the world.  The first step to determine the choice of law is to look at the law expressly agreed between the account holder and its direct intermediary to govern the securities account. The choice of law, however, is constrained to the extent that the intermediary must have in the chosen State an office that regularly maintains securities accounts. If the account agreement does not contain such a choice of law clause, but expressly and unambiguously states that the relevant intermediary entered into the account agreement through a particular office, the applicable law is the law of the location of such office, provided that it regularly maintains securities accounts. If this test also provides no answer, the Convention considers, as the ultimate fallback, the law of the place of incorporation or organisation of the relevant intermediary.",

The Convention governs international civil and business-to-business agreements that designate a single court, or the courts of a single country, for resolution of disputes.  It does not apply to agreements that include a consumer as a party, or to purely domestic agreements in which the parties are resident in the same Contracting State and all other elements relevant to the dispute are connected only with that State. The Convention sets out three basic rules: - the court chosen by the parties in an exclusive choice of court agreement has jurisdiction; - if an exclusive choice of court agreement exists, a court not chosen by the parties does not have jurisdiction, and must decline to hear the case; and  - a judgment resulting from jurisdiction exercised in accordance with an exclusive choice of court agreement must be recognized and enforced in the courts of other Contracting States.",

The Protocol is optional and participation is open to all States party to the 1992 Fund Convention (Fund 2). The total amount of compensation payable for any one incident will be limited to a combined total of 750 million Special Drawing Rights (SDR) (just over US$1,000 million) including the amount of compensation paid under the existing CLC/Fund Convention.  Annual contributions to the Fund will be made in respect of each Contracting State by any person who, in any calendar year, has received total quantities of oil exceeding 150,000 tons. However, for the purposes of the Protocol, there is a minimum aggregate receipt of 1,000,000 tons of contributing oil in each Contracting State.  The Assembly of the Supplementary Fund will assess the level of contributions based on estimates of expenditure (including administrative costs and payments to be made under the Fund as a result of claims) and income (including surplus funds from previous years, annual contributions and any other income).  Amendments to the compensation limits established under the Protocol can be adopted by a tacit acceptance procedure, so that an amendment adopted in the Legal Committee of IMO by a two-thirds majority of Contracting States present and voting, can enter into force 24 months after its adoption.",
        "relevant": "The Supplementary Fund substantially increases the total amount of compensation payable in the case of qualifying incidents. The extra compensation made available, will more fully cover the damage of polluting incidents that would not otherwise be covered to any significant degree by the original Fund. An example of such an incident is the Prestige catastrophe in Spain in 2002 where only 15% of the total loss could be repaid in response to each valid claim.",
        "aditional": "The supplementary fund will apply to damage in the territory, including the territorial sea, of a Contracting State and in the exclusive economic zone of a Contracting State."

The Protocol covers pollution damage as before but environmental damage compensation is limited to costs incurred for reasonable measures to reinstate the contaminated environment. It also allows expenses incurred for preventive measures to be recovered even when no spill of oil occurs, provided there was grave and imminent threat of pollution damage.  The Protocol also extended the Convention to cover spills from sea-going vessels constructed or adapted to carry oil in bulk as cargo so that it applies to both laden and unladen tankers, including spills of bunker oil from such ships.  Under the 1992 Protocol, a shipowner cannot limit liability if it is proved that the pollution damage resulted from the shipowner's personal act or omission, committed with the intent to cause such damage, or recklessly and with knowledge that such damage would probably result.",

This is important because a ship which has only a 1969 CLC may find it difficult to trade to a country which has ratified the 1992 Protocol, as it establishes higher limits of liability.  From 16 May 1998, Parties to the 1992 Protocol ceased to be Parties to the 1969 CLC due to a mechanism for compulsory denunciation of the \"old\" regime established in the 1992 Protocol. However, for the time being, the two regimes co-exist, since there are a number of States, which are party to the 1969 CLC and have not yet ratified the 1992 regime - which is intended to eventually replace the 1969 CLC.",

This result is a six-fold increase in the amount of compensation available  The Protocol not only substantially increases the amount of compensation payable in the event of an incident, but also introduces a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tacit acceptance\u00e2\u20ac\u009d procedure for updating these amounts.

The problems faced by coastal states and shipping in general as a result of abandoned wrecks are three-fold: first, and depending on its location, a wreck may constitute a hazard to navigation, potentially endangering other vessels and their crews; second, and of equal concern, depending on the nature of the cargo, is the potential for a wreck to cause substantial damage to the marine and coastal environments; and third, in an age where goods and services are becoming increasingly expensive, is the issue of the costs involved in the marking and removal of hazardous wrecks.

The requirements of the Convention apply to the great majority of freight containers used internationally, except those designed specially for carriage by air.

A salvor who prevented a major pollution incident (for example, by towing a damaged tanker away from an environmentally sensitive area) but did not manage to save the ship or the cargo got nothing. There was therefore little incentive to a salvor to undertake an operation which has only a slim chance of success.  The 1989 Convention seeks to remedy this deficiency by making provision for an enhanced salvage award taking into account the skill and efforts of the salvors in preventing or minimizing damage to the environment.",

The necessity for this Convention is well illustrated by the devastating effects of the distribution of certain strains of Cholera in ships\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ballast water. In 1991, this distribution led to an epidemic in Peru, before sweeping across South America, affecting more than a million people and killing more than ten thousand by 1994.

The SUA Convention 1988 is in place to ensure that participating states take appropriate action against persons committing unlawful acts against ships.

This does not mean that ratifying States would necessarily have to undertake archaeological excavations; they only have to take measures according to their capabilities. The Convention encourages scientific research and public access.</li>\n\t<li><strong><em>In Situ&nbsp;</em>Preservation as first option</strong> - The <em>in situ</em>&nbsp;preservation of underwater cultural heritage (i.e. in its original location on the seafloor) should be considered as the first option before allowing or engaging in any further&nbsp;activities. The recovery of objects may,&nbsp;however, be authorized for the purpose of making a significant contribution to the protection&nbsp;or knowledge of&nbsp;underwater cultural heritage.</li>\n\t<li><strong>No Commercial Exploitation</strong> - The 2001 Convention stipulates that underwater cultural heritage should not be commercially exploited for trade or speculation, and that it should not be irretrievably dispersed. This regulation is in conformity with the moral principles that already apply to cultural heritage on land. It is not to be understood as preventing archaeological research or tourist access.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Training and Information Sharing</strong> - States Parties shall cooperate and exchange information, promote training in underwater archaeology and promote public awareness regarding the value and importance of&nbsp;Underwater Cultural Heritage.</li>\n</ul>",

The Rules on Transparency, effective as of 1 April 2014, are a set of procedural rules for making publicly available information on investor-State arbitrations arising under investment treaties. In relation to investment treaties concluded prior to 1 April 2014, the Rules apply, inter alia, when Parties to the relevant investment treaty agree to their application. The Convention is an efficient and flexible mechanism for recording such agreement.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Key provisions</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Convention supplements existing investment treaties with respect to transparency-related obligations. Article 2, a key provision of the Convention, determines when and how the Rules on Transparency shall apply to investor-State arbitration within the scope of the Convention. In contrast to the Rules on Transparency, whether the arbitration is initiated under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules or not does not have any impact on the application of the Convention. The general rule of application is stipulated in paragraph 1 (bilateral or multilateral application) and paragraph 2 refers to the application of the Rules on Transparency when only the respondent State (and not the State of the investor-claimant) is a party to the Convention (unilateral offer of application).</p>\n\n<p>A Party to the Convention has the flexibility to formulate reservations, thereby excluding from the application of the Convention a specific investment treaty or a specific set of arbitration rules other than the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (negative-list approach). A Party may also declare that it will not provide a unilateral offer of application. Lastly, in the event the Rules on Transparency are revised, a Party may also declare, within a limited period of time after such revision, that it will not apply that revised version. By defining specific timing for the formulation and withdrawal of reservations, the Convention provides the necessary level of flexibility, while ensuring that reservations cannot be used to defeat the purpose of the Convention.</p>\n\n<p>The Convention and any reservation thereto apply prospectively, that is to arbitral proceedings commenced after the entry into force of the Convention for the Party concerned.</p>\n\n<p>Together with the Rules on Transparency, the Convention takes into the account both the public interest in such arbitration and the interest of the parties to resolve disputes in a fair and efficient manner. The Convention foresees the Secretary-General of the United Nations as performing the repository function, through the UNCITRAL secretariat (see the <a href=\"http://www.uncitral.org/transparency-registry/registry/index.jspx\">Transparency Registry</a>).</p>",

He said all delegations showed &ldquo;an openness to discuss different approaches in a very positive spirit.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The President of the Diplomatic Conference Ambassador Luis Enrique Ch&aacute;vez Basagoitia, Permanent Representative of Peru to the United Nations Office and other international organizations in Geneva expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the diplomatic conference and called the adoption of the Geneva Act a &ldquo;transcendental moment&rdquo; for the Lisbon Union and WIPO.</p>\n\n<p>The Geneva Act of the Lisbon Agreement further develops the legal framework of the <a href=\"http://www.wipo.int/lisbon/en/\" target=\"_self\">Lisbon System</a>, which helps promote many globally marketed products such as, for example, Scotch whisky, Darjeeling tea and Caf&eacute; de Colombia.</p>\n\n<p>Other changes affect fee provisions, scope of protection, protection against becoming generic, and safeguards for respect of prior trademark rights.</p>\n\n<p>An official signing ceremony is scheduled for May 21, 2015, at WIPO&rsquo;s Geneva headquarters.</p>\n\n<p>The Geneva Act of the Lisbon Agreement will enter into force three months after five eligible parties have deposited their instruments of ratification or accession.</p>\n\n<p>The basic negotiating text for the Diplomatic Conference was developed between 2008 and 2014 by a Lisbon System working group with the goal of attracting a wider membership to the System, while preserving its principles and objectives.</p>\n\n<p>The Lisbon Agreement for the Protection of Appellations of Origin and their International Registration was originally concluded in 1958.</p>\n\n<h2>Background</h2>\n\n<p>Broadly speaking, a <a href=\"http://www.wipo.int/geo_indications/en/\" target=\"_self\">geographical indication</a> is a sign used on goods that have a specific geographical origin and possess qualities, reputation or characteristics that are essentially attributable to that place of origin. An appellation of origin is a similar type of sign, but often with more stringent criteria for usage.</p>\n\n<p>Appellations of originand geographical indications both require a qualitative link between the product to which they refer and its place of origin. Both inform consumers about a product&rsquo;s geographical origin and a quality, characteristic or reputation (for geographical indications) of the product linked to its place of origin. The basic difference between the two terms is that the link with the place of origin is stronger in the case of an appellation of origin.</p>\n\n<p>The quality or characteristics of a product protected as an appellation of origin must result exclusively or essentially from its geographical origin. This generally means that the raw materials should be sourced in the place of origin and that the processing of the product should also happen there.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of geographical indications, a single criterion attributable to geographical origin is sufficient for the geographical indication to qualify as such, which may also be the specific reputation of the product. Moreover, the production of the raw materials and the development or processing of a geographical indication product do not necessarily have to take place entirely in the defined geographical area.</p>\n\n<p>Additional examples of appellations of origin and geographical indications are Gouda Holland, Argan Oil, Swiss watches and Tequila.</p>",
