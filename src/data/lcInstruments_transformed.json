    "aboutInfo": "This Convention provides a uniform regime of law for both stand-by letter of credit and independent guarantees.   It addresses such matters as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153form and content of undertaking\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rights and obligations\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153demands by the beneficiary\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.  It as well offers guidance to settle conflict of law matters.   The Convention sets forth the basic principles of law for independent undertakings in a manner which fully assures their independent nature, which guarantees widest possible party autonomy and which establishes a uniform international legal standard for limits to the exception for fraudulent or abusive drawings.",
    "relevantInfo": "The Convention assists parties doing cross-border business based on letters of credit in those countries which do not have a developed body of law governing letters of credit.    This Convention was welcomed by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC).  ICC rules cannot be fully effective in all countries without their being recognized under local law. In this respect, the United Nations Convention on Independent Guarantees and Stand-by Letters of Credit provides an important impetus to attain this objective. The Convention was drafted in full recognition of the role of the various ICC rules in this field.",
    "additionalInfo": "This Convention strongly influenced the revision of the ICC's Uniform Rules for Demand Guarantees (URDG) and its recently adopted rules on International Standby Practices (ISP 98)."

    "aboutInfo": "The Convention presents, for optional use in international transactions, a modern, comprehensive set of rules for international bills of exchange and international promissory notes. The text of the Convention reflects a deliberate policy to minimize departures from the content of common and civil law systems, preserving, where possible, the rules on which those systems concur. Where conflicts exist, requiring selection of one system's rule or a compromise solution, the Convention introduces a number of novel provisions. Another group of new rules are the result of special efforts to have the Convention respond to modern commercial needs and banking and financial market practices.  According to the Convention, a bill of exchange is a written instrument which: a) contains an unconditional order whereby the drawer directs the drawee to pay a definite sum of money to the payee or to its order; b) is payable on demand or at a definite time; c) is dated; and d) is signed by the drawer. A promissory note is a written instrument which: a) contains an unconditional promise whereby the maker undertakes to pay a definite sum of money to the payee or to its order; b) is payable on demand or at a definite time; c) is dated; d) is signed by the maker.",
    "relevantInfo": "The Convention as adopted aims at facilitating international trade and finance by  reducing uncertainty related to International Bills of Exchange and International Promissory Notes.

Applicable national laws are used if no mention is made.  The Convention is similar to the Convention Providing a Uniform Law For Bills of Exchange and Promissory Notes (Geneva, 7 June 1930), though that Convention is most relevant for civil law systems."

It is adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (New York, 9 May 1992).  The Kyoto Protocol concerns six gases (CO2, CH4, N2O, HFC, PFC and SF6).  Developed countries are required to lower their emissions of these noxious gases by at least 5% below the 1990 levels.  The requirements vary by State but must be established at least between 2008 and 2012.  In order to achieve these objectives, State parties are required to improve their energy yield, reform their energy and transport sectors, promote the usage of renewable energies and to protect their forests. Some flexibility is offered to States that cannot reduce their internal emissions enough to satisfy their international obligations. The Protocol includes three market-based instruments known as the Kyoto Mechanisms that allow countries to earn or buy credits outside their borders. States may also fulfil their obligations by financing projects leading to the reduction of greenhouse gases.  These projects may be undertaken on either their own territory or that of another State.",

It also promotes direct investment in the energy sector under the principle of non-discrimination.   It as well acknowledges the sovereignty of a state over its energy resources and recognizes the necessity for a State to have an environmentally friendly and efficient energy policy. There is an arbitration mechanism for disputes in connection with the Treaty under Part V.   These disputes may be between investors and contracting parties, or between contracting parties.

The Protocol has three objectives.  First, to promote energy efficiency policies consistent with sustainable development.  Second, to create conditions which induce producers and consumers to use energy as efficiently and environmentally sound as possible (particularly through the organization of efficient energy markets and a recognition of environmental costs and benefits).  Third, to foster cooperation in the field of energy efficiency.

Respect for those principles is necessary to ensure fairness in dealings.  This Convention is intended to alleviate the difficulties that have emerged at international level in obtaining information and facts and in punishing persons carrying out operations on organised stock market securities that are at variance with those principles. State parties to this Convention agree to exchange information and provide mutual assistance in criminal matters related to insider trading.  They also agree to judicial cooperation in that respect.  For the purpose of this Convention an irregular operation of insider trading means an operation carried out by a person with privileged information who has effected an operation on an organized stock exchange with a view of securing an advantage for himself or a third party.  The provisions of this text do not deal with questions related to punishment of such crimes.",

Despite its popularity, however, is has often been criticized for offering few tools to stop the trade in stolen and looted art.   Under this Convention, State Parties recognize that the illicit import, export and transfer of ownership of cultural property is one of the main causes of the impoverishment of the cultural heritage of the countries of origin of such property and that international co-operation constitutes one of the most efficient means of protecting each country's cultural property.  In order to limit such trade, State parties agree to provide for measures ensuring that exported goods can be traced and agree to improve controls to prevent the import of goods using fraudulent methods. It has been criticised that member State are able to keep their own national laws regarding the protection of cultural property, that the text utilizes broad and unspecific language, and that no specific enforcement mechanisms are provided.  As most of the member States are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153source\u00e2\u20ac\u009d countries, the effectiveness of the present Convention is further limited. Another criticism stems from the fact that the UNESCO Convention only provides protection for art stolen from an inventory and public collection.

It also mandates that no nation may accord its own nationals stronger copyright protection than that given to nationals of other signatory parties, though a state may make exceptions under certain conditions. A formal copyright notice must appear in all copies of a work and consist of the symbol \u00c2\u00a9, the name of the copyright owner, and the year of first publication.   A State Party, however, may require other formalities, provided domestic works are not favoured over foreign. The Convention was supplemented by two protocols adopted the same day.

Among all the contracting States, the applicant indicates those in which he wishes his international application to have effect (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153designated States\u00e2\u20ac\u009d). The effect of the international application in each designated State is the same as if a national patent application had been filed with the national patent office of that State. The international application is then subjected to an international search, carried out by one of the major patent offices and results in an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153international search report\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, a listing of the citations of published documents that might affect the patentability of the invention claimed in the international application. The international search report is communicated to the applicant who may decide to withdraw his application, in particular where the content of the report suggests that the granting of patents is unlikely, or to amend the claims in the application. If the international application is not withdrawn, it is, together with the international search report, published by the International Bureau and communicated to each designated Office. If the applicant decides to continue with the international application with a view to obtaining national (or regional) patents, he can wait until the end of the 20th month from the priority date (that is, until the end of the 20th month after the filing of the international application or, where that application claims the priority of an earlier application, until the end of the 20th month after the filing of that earlier application), to commence the national procedure before each designated Office by furnishing a translation (where necessary) of the application into the official language of that Office and paying the necessary fees.",

It applies to industrial property rights, including patents, trademarks, industrial designs, utility models, trade names, indications of source, appellations of origin and the repression of unfair competition. The substantive provisions of the Convention fall into three main categories: national treatment, right of priority and common rules.  The Convention mandates that each contracting State must grant the same advantages to nationals of other contracting States as it grants to its own nationals in matters related to industrial property.  The right of priority in the case of patents means that, on the basis of a regular first application filed in one of the contracting States, the applicant may, within a certain period of time apply for protection in any of the other contracting States; these later applications will then be regarded as if they had been filed on the same day as the first application. In other words, these later applications will have priority over applications that may have been filed during the said period of time by other persons for the same invention, utility model, mark or industrial design.",

It was further modified on 28 September 1979.   The Assembly, the Executive Committee, and the International Bureau of WIPO carry out the administrative tasks of the Convention.

Under the Madrid Protocol a trademark applicant may file an application for international trademark registration, which then takes effect in all State parties to the Protocol. The scope of the Madrid Protocol is similar to the scope of the Agreement, though varying in certain significant aspects. As the 1891 Agreement was not widely accepted, the Protocol addresses the criticised issues. Under the 1891 Agreement, the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153home\u00e2\u20ac\u009d registration of a mark is required before an international application may be made. A trademark applicant must register a mark in his or her own State before seeking registration abroad.  Under the 1989 Protocol, however, an application for international registration can be submitted before an application for national registration is approved.   According to the 1891 Agreement a national registration revocation also results in an international revocation. The 1989 Protocol differs. As five years after issuance an international registration becomes independent of the national registration, an international revocation only occurs if the national registration is cancelled within that time period. Even in the event of a revocation, the 1989 Protocol allows applicants to pursue national registrations in multiple jurisdictions using the original filing date of the international registration.    The present Protocol raises the delay during which a State can refuse to recognize the deposit of a trademark from 12 to 18 months. The renewal period is reduced to 10 years from 20 years, and the application may now be submitted in English or French.",

The information presented in the Guide is intended to explain why the provisions in the Model Law have been included as essential minimum features of a modern procurement law.",
    "relevantInfo": "The decision by UNCITRAL to formulate model legislation on procurement was taken in response to the fact that in a number of countries the existing legislation governing procurement is inadequate or outdated. This results in inefficiency and ineffectiveness in the procurement process, patterns of abuse, and the failure of the public purchaser to obtain adequate value in return for the expenditure of public funds. In several countries, a substantial portion of all procurement is channelled through the public sector. Much of such procurement is in connection with projects that are part of the essential process of economic and social development. Those countries in particular suffer from a shortage of public funds to be used for procurement. It is thus critical that procurement be carried out in the most advantageous way possible.  The Model Law may help to remedy disadvantages that stem from the fact that inadequate procurement legislation at the national level creates obstacles to international trade, a significant amount of which is linked to procurement. Disparities among and uncertainty about national legal regimes governing procurement may contribute to limiting the extent to which Governments can access the competitive price and quality benefits available through procurement on an international basis.

After a long interruption in the work as a result of the Second World War, the draft was submitted to a diplomatic conference in The Hague in 1964, which adopted two conventions, one on the international sale of goods and the other on the formation of contracts for the international sale of goods.  Almost immediately upon the adoption of the two conventions there was widespread criticism of their provisions as reflecting primarily the legal traditions and economic realities of continental Western Europe, which was the region that had most actively contributed to their preparation. As a result, one of the first tasks undertaken by UNCITRAL on its organization in 1968 was to enquire of States whether or not they intended to adhere to those conventions and the reasons for their positions. In the light of the responses received, UNCITRAL decided to study the two conventions to ascertain which modifications might render them capable of wider acceptance by countries of different legal, social and economic systems. The result of this study was the adoption by diplomatic conference on 11 April 1980 of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, which combines the subject matter of the two prior conventions."

Published by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), Incoterms have been the subject of several revisions to reflect developments in international trade.  The ICC introduced the first version of Incoterms in 1936. They have since undergone six revisions (1953, 1967, 1976, 1980, 1990 and 2000).

The need for improvement and harmonization was based on findings that national laws were often inappropriate for international cases. The expectations of parties to an arbitration agreement referring to a chosen set of arbitration rules or an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ad hoc\u00e2\u20ac\u009d arbitration agreement might be frustrated by national laws which affected the parties\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ability to submit future disputes to arbitration, select the arbitrator freely or have the arbitral proceedings conducted according to the agreed rules of procedure and with no more court involvement than appropriate.

    "aboutInfo": "This instrument, initiated by the International Law Commission (ILC), aims at regulating the fate of treaties in instances of State succession (it acts in situations in which one State substitutes another in the responsibility for the international relations of a territory).  The Convention of 1978 envisions two situations: first successions that only concern one part of a territory (when the successor is not a new State), and second successions which lead to the creation of States.  In the first case, treaties concluded by the successor State are extended to the transferred territory to which the treaties of the predecessor applied (principle of automatic extension).  In the second case, the successor state is a non-member state with respect to the treaties of the predecessor.  It cannot, except in particular cases, receive its benefits (principle of intransmissibility).  The provisions of this instrument regulate both bilateral treaties and multilateral treaties.",
    "relevantInfo": "The 1978 Vienna Convention makes it possible to determine which are the obligations which international law imposes on States successors as regards treaties. Many of its provisions are drawn from customary international law.  This convention, initially adopted in order to answer the difficulties caused by the appearance of new States following colonization, has seen its utility reinforced during the recent creation of states following the dissolution of the USSR and that of Yugoslavia.",

The effect of State succession in other matters (property, archives, state debts) is covered by the Convention on Succession of States in respect of State Property, Archives and Debts (Vienna, April 8, 1983)."

    "aboutInfo": "The A.T.A. Convention allows the free and temporary movement of goods into a customs territory with minimum customs formalities.  The term A.T.A. is derived from a combination of the French (admission temporaire) and English (temporary admission). An A.T.A. Carnet is a standard international customs document for the temporary duty free importation of goods.  The A.T.A. Carnet acts as a guarantee that all customs duties and import taxes will be paid should the item not be re-exported within a mandated time period, at most one year.  As they are an accepted customs document, the amount of import and export paperwork is significantly reduced.  The A.T.A. Carnet also serves as an exemption for taxes normally required in countries of destination or transit. A.T.A. Carnets are used for commercial samples to be demonstrated, the temporary import of professional equipment necessary to perform a task, the import of goods for display or use at exhibitions, fairs or meetings, as well as for goods with an educational, scientific or cultural character.  A.T.A. Carnets specifically cannot be used for perishable products.   National chamber of commerce associations that are approved by Customs are authorized to issue ATA Carnets.  The associations must also be affiliated with an international guaranteeing chain administered by the World Chambers federation headquartered at the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris.",
    "relevantInfo": "By allowing for rapid movement, the A.T.A Carnets benefit both traders as well as customs officials.   The carnet is accepted in over 60 countries and saves costs in clearing goods, as well as inspires increased transport across borders.   The A.T.A. can be used by all professions having an international activity (industry, businessmen, artists, sportsmen, etc.).",

    "aboutInfo": "The identification of goods is an important element of customs work. Such identification allows for the correct application of customs tariffs and it improves the collection of trade statistics. The Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (HS) is an internationally accepted method for the identification of goods.  The HS establishes an international nomenclature that allows goods to be categorized quickly and accurately.  The harmonized system includes approximately 5000 categories of goods classified by a six-digit code.  The system also contains 21 sections, 97 chapters and 1241 headings at the four-digit level, 930 of which are further divided into sub headings. States that have agreed to the Harmonized System Convention are committed to employing the six-digit system.  They may also use a more detailed classification system with a greater number of digits at the national level.  Goods are classified according to objective criteria that are designed to be precise in their application. The harmonized system is used by States as a foundation for commercial negotiations, the collection of data on international commerce, the control of quotas, and the application of customs tariffs.  It is subject to revisions every four to six years, to reflect changes in both technology and in international trade.",
    "relevantInfo": "The harmonized system is used by nearly 180 countries and is applied to more than 98% of the goods traded worldwide.  It is a valuable tool for the implementation of customs laws.    It reduces costs for both the public and private sector, as countries do not need to invent their own classification system.  Developing countries that adopt this Convention have the possibility to opt for a partial application of the harmonized system, depending upon the specifics of their administrative capacities.  Technical assistance is also offered to adapt their nomenclatures to the harmonized system.",

The privileges stipulated by this agreement are not applicable with respect to airports utilized for military purposes to the exclusion of any scheduled international air services. In addition, the exercise of these privileges should be also in accordance with the provisions of the Convention on International Civil Aviation (also signed in Chicago, 07/12/1944).                                                   1 For many years, Governments used as a model for bilateral air services agreement the bilateral agreement between United States and Great Britain, known as Bermuda I (1949). In 1976, Great Britain renounced the Bermuda I and one year later another bilateral agreement was negotiated, the Bermuda II. Nevertheless, Governments have not resorted to this last agreement as a model.

This instrument also deals with the designation of routes to be followed within the Contracting States\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 territory; the charges for the use of airport and other facilities related to air transit; and the settlement of disagreements amongst the Governments.",
    "relevantInfo": "In practice most Governments preferred to ratify the International Air Services Transit Agreement (Chicago, 07/12/1944) and not the present Convention. The reason being the scope of the present Convention was two broad, encompassing the last three freedoms directly related to traffic (rights related to the commercial exchange of goods).",
    "additionalInfo": "The international community broadly accepted the first two privileges. Nevertheless, opposition was raised against the multilateral acceptance of the extensive privileges granted by the other three freedoms. The fifth right in particular, which allows an international airline to operate from one country to the other and then continue to a further country, was bitterly opposed. This fact amounted to a not significant acceptance of this Agreement (the last ratification dates from 1968 by Burundi and the USA withdrew from it in 1946, alleging that commercial value had been granted away by this Agreement). On the other hand, the International Air Services Transit Agreement (also signed in Chicago, 07/12/1944), which includes just the first two privileges, was largely accepted. The privileges are not applicable with respect to airports utilized for military purposes to the exclusion of any scheduled international air services. In addition, the exercise of these privileges should be in accordance with the provisions of the Convention on International Civil Aviation (also signed in Chicago, 07/12/1944). Moreover, the Contracting States accept this Agreement as abrogating all understandings and obligations between them that are inconsistent with its terms. If an airline of any Contracting State enters into any such inconsistent obligations, the State of which it is a national should use its best efforts to secure their termination."

    "aboutInfo": "This Convention aims to protect plant varieties via sui generis rights.  State parties to the Convention are required to grant persons who bred, or discovered and developed a plant variety exclusive rights regarding production, reproduction (multiplication), sale, marketing, exporting, importing or stocking. Such protection is offered to all nationals and residents of a State party as well as to legal entities having their registered offices within the territory of a State party. The principle of national treatment is applicable in this regard. The rights established by this Convention do not extend to acts done privately and for non-commercial purposes, or to acts done for experimental purposes, nor to acts done for the purpose of breeding other varieties. No State party may restrict the free exercise of a breeder's right for reasons other than public interest and only in exchange for fair remuneration. Any breeder, who has filed an application for the protection of a variety in one of the State parties, enjoys for the purpose of filing an application for the grant of a breeder's right for the same variety with the authority of any other State party, the right of priority for a period of twelve months.",
    "relevantInfo": "The present Convention protects the creation of new varieties of plants, which is essential to quantitatively and qualititatively improve food production.

    "relevantInfo": "The UNCITRAL Model Law was prepared in response to a major change in the means by which funds transfers are made internationally. This change involved two elements: the increased use of payment orders sent by electronic means rather than on paper, and the shift from the generalized use of debit transfers to the generalized use of credit transfers. One result was that previous efforts to unify the law governing international debit transfers were not relevant to the new funds transfer techniques. The Model Law offers the opportunity to unify the law of credit transfers by enacting a text that is drafted to meet the needs of modern funds transfer techniques.",

The primary objective of this instrument is to protect traditional forests by developing a sustainable management approach to timber resources and to reduce their depletion through over logging. Therefore, the sales price must reflect the real value of the resource and exported tropical timbers must be from forests run by sustainable management practices. A special fund assists producing countries to undertake the reforms and investments necessary to carry out sustainable management of timber resources.

From 1987 to 2005, ITTO has funded more than 600 projects, pre-projects and activities valued at more than US$250 million. In addition, States party to the Agreement develop internationally agreed policy documents to promote sustainable forest management and forest conservation and assist tropical member countries to adapt such policies to local circumstances. An equal partnership in decision-making, policy formulation and project development between producing members (tropical developing countries) and tropical timber consuming members (mostly temperate developed countries) characterizes the Agreement.",

    "aboutInfo": "This instrument, regulating fishing of tuna, applies to all waters of the Atlantic Ocean and adjacent seas, including the Mediterranean Sea. There is no precise definition in terms of longitude and latitude. The Convention\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s principal objective is to co-operate in maintaining the population of tunas and tuna-like species found in the Atlantic Ocean and the adjacent seas at levels that will permit the maximum sustainable catch for food and other purposes. Following the entry into force of the present Convention, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) was established. This Commission is responsible for studying the populations of tuna and tuna-like fishes and such other species of fishes exploited in tuna fishing.  Headquartered in Madrid, it is required to conduct scientific research and appraise information concerning measures and methods to ensure maintenance of the populations of tuna and tuna-like fishes in the Convention area. All recommendations made by the Commission become effective for State parties six months after their date of notification, though objections may be made.",

Its adoption supersedes the four Geneva Conventions of 1958, (Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone, Convention on the Continental Shelf, Convention on the High Seas, and the Convention of the Living Resources of the High Seas).  There are two implementation agreements related to this Convention.  In 1994, an Agreement on the Implementation of Part XI of the Convention was proposed by the UN General Assembly to address certain difficulties with the seabed mining provisions.  In 1995, the Agreement for the Implementation of the Law of the Sea Convention relating to the Management and Conservation of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks was adopted, which set out principles for fish conservation and management and established that such management must be based on the precautionary approach.",

    "aboutInfo": "The Codex Alimentarius Commission was created in 1963 by FAO and WHO to develop food standards, guidelines and related texts such as codes of practice under the Joint FAO/WHO Food Standards Programme. The main purposes of this Programme are protecting health of the consumers, ensuring fair trade practices in the food trade and promoting coordination of all food standards work undertaken by international governmental and non-governmental organizations. The Codex Alimentarius contains more than 200 standards in the prescribed format for individual foods or groups of foods. In addition, it includes the General Standard for the Labelling of Pre-packaged Foods, the Codex General Guidelines on Claims and the Codex Guidelines on Nutrition Labelling, all of which are aimed at ensuring honest practices in the sale of food while also providing guidance to consumers in their choice of products. Other general standards for food hygiene, food additives, contaminants or toxins in food and for irradiated foods are of major importance in protecting consumers' health and they are valued widely for this purpose. Similarly, maximum residue limits for pesticides and veterinary drugs and maximum limits for food additives and contaminants have been established to ensure that consumers are not exposed to unsafe levels of hazardous materials.",
    "relevantInfo": "The Codex Alimentarius Commission provides a forum for all participating States to discuss and present Codex-related issues. Particularly developing countries should take advantage of this forum to promote their point of views and ensure fair trade practices, as the influence of the Codex extends to every continent. Membership is open to all Member Nations and Associate Members of FAO/WHO.  A principal concern of national governments is that food imported from other countries should be safe and not jeopardize the health of consumers or pose a threat to the health and safety of their animal and plant populations. Consequently, governments of importing countries have introduced mandatory laws and regulations to eliminate or minimize such threats. In the area of food, animal and plant control, these measures could lead to the creation of barriers to international food trade. The adoption of Codex standards as scientifically justified norms is of immense significance. The standards have become an integral part of a legal framework facilitating international trade through harmonization and they have been used as benchmark in international trade disputes. Since the 1994 Uruguay Round Agreements on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS) and Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT), both encouraging the international harmonization of food standards, the Codex Alimentarius has gained further importance. Thereagreements encourage Member States to the World Trade Organization to apply the rules of the Codex Alimentarius. While the growing world interest in all Codex activities clearly indicates global acceptance of the Codex philosophy - embracing harmonization, consumer protection and facilitation of international trade - in practice it is difficult for many countries to accept Codex standards in the statutory sense. Differing legal formats and administrative systems, varying political systems and sometimes the influence of national attitudes and concepts of sovereign rights impede the progress of harmonization and deter the acceptance of Codex standards. Despite these difficulties, however, the process of harmonization is gaining impetus by virtue of the strong international desire to facilitate trade.",

    "aboutInfo": "From the beginning of the space age, deliberate efforts to create a coherent body of law for outer space and space activities were undertaken at the United Nations. The General Assembly adopted three UN Resolutions stating general rules on the law of outer space: - Resolution 1962 on the declaration of legal principles governing the activities of States in the exploration and use of outer space (13 December 1963); - Resolution 1884 calling upon States from placing in orbit around the earth any objects carrying nuclear weapons or any other kind of weapons of mass destruction or from installing such weapons on celestial bodies (17 October 1963);  - Resolution 110 condemning propaganda designed or likely to provoke or encourage any threat to the peace, breach of the peace or act of aggression (3 November 1947).  The conclusion of multilateral treaties has become the principal means of enacting pertinent legal rules. Considering the fundamental statements of the Resolutions and desiring to contribute to the development of mutual understanding and to the strengthening of friendly relations between States and peoples, the Treaty governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon and other Celestial Bodies (Outer Space Treaty) affirms the freedom of exploration and use of outer space and prohibits all claims of sovereignty. It also proscribes the establishment of military bases, installations or fortifications on celestial bodies and the placement in orbit around the earth of objects carrying weapons of mass destruction. It constitutes a legal hindrance to the installation of nuclear explosives in space. Carriage of weapons through space and exploration by artificial satellites remain authorized.",
    "relevantInfo": "The Outer Space Treaty provides the basis for all subsequent treaties and other legal instruments relating to space activities. The exploration and use of outer space is a global problem affecting the entire international community. Recognizes this fact, the Treaty stresses \"the common interest of all mankind\" in the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes. This provision provides sufficient legal grounds for claims to full and effective participation by all members of the internationalcommunity in the decision-making process relating to outer space. Consequently real progress in the development of legal norms applicable to the use and exploration of outer space can only be made when as many states as possible, including all states having the capability to engage in outer space activities, are actively in agreement.",

It implements the principles set forth in the 1967 Treaty governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon and other Celestial Bodies.  A launching State has the absolute liability to pay compensation for damage caused by its space object on the surface of the earth or to aircraft in flight, whereas damage implies loss of life, personal injury and the loss of or damage to personal property. In the event of damage being caused elsewhere than on the surface of the earth to a space object of a launching State by a space object of another launching State, the liability of the latter is engaged if the damage is due to its fault. A claim for compensation for damage has to be presented to a launching State through diplomatic channels. If a State does not maintain diplomatic relations with the launching State concerned, its claim may be presented through a third State or the Secretary General of the United Nations. The provisions of the Convention do not apply to damage caused by a space object of a launching State to nationals of that State, neither to foreign nationals participating in the operation of the damaging space object, nor to guests invited to the launching or recovery area. Two or more States engaging commonly to launch an object into space are jointly liable for all resulting damages.",

    "aboutInfo": "The International Institute for the Unification of Private Law (UNIDROIT) is an Intergovernmental Organisation based in Rome. Its purpose is to study needs and methods for modernising, harmonising and co-ordinating private law \u00e2\u20ac\u201c both civil and commercial \u00e2\u20ac\u201c between States and groups of States.  UNIDROIT is composed of a Secretariat, a Governing Council and a General Assembly. The Secretariat carries out feasibility studies and preliminary comparative law reports on topics included in the UNIDROIT's Work Programme. Reports are then submitted to the Governing Council that \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where appropriate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c will ask the Secretariat to convene a study group of governmental experts for the preparation of a preliminary draft Convention or an alternative legal instrument. Draft Conventions are analysed by the Governing Council for approval. Where it judges that a draft Convention reflects a consensus as between the States which have participated in the study committee, the Governing Council calls for a diplomatic Conference for its adoption.  The uniform rules drawn up by UNIDROIT have traditionally taken the form of international Conventions, designed to apply to a State\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s municipal law upon completion of all the formal requirements of that State\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s domestic law for their entry into force. Alternative forms of unification \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such as model laws and legal guides \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are adopted by UNIDROIT in areas where a binding instrument is not considered to be essential.",
    "relevantInfo": "By adhering to UNIDROIT, States can participate in the process of drafting and adopting multilateral trade treaties, model laws and legal guides in the field of commercial law. Full participation in UNIDROIT committees of governmental experts is only open to representatives of UNIDROIT member States. Where commercial transactions tend to be transnational by their very nature, harmonised rules and widely accepted legal solutions help international trade. UNIDROIT's basic statutory objective is to prepare modern and harmonised uniform rules of private law. UNIDROIT is mainly concerned with substantive rules of law, in important commercial areas such as the international sale of goods, international contracts, international financial leasing, international factoring, etc.",
    "additionalInfo": "The Secretariat may invite other States, International Organisations and professional associations to participate in UNIDROIT committees of governmental experts as observers, in light of the subject matter concerned.  In addition, UNIDROIT maintains close ties with International Organisations, both intergovernmental and non-governmental, which in many cases take the form of co-operation agreements concluded at inter-Secretariat level."

ISO is the world's largest developer of international standards. Since its establishment in 1947, it has published more than 13 700 International Standards. ISO standards are technical agreements providing the framework for compatible technology worldwide. International standards play a key role in improving efficiency of production and facilitating international trade. International Standards create \"a level playing field\" for all competitors on international markets. The existence of divergent national or regional standards can create technical barriers to trade, even when restrictive import quotas and tariffs have been reduced.  ISO standards are voluntary.

The TBT Agreement recognizes the important contribution that international standards and conformity assessment systems can make to improving efficiency of production and facilitating international trade. Therefore, where International Standards exist or their completion is imminent, the Code states that standardizing bodies should use them as a basis for standards they develop.

Securities are defined by the Convention as any shares, bonds or other financial instruments or financial assets (other than cash), or any interest therein. The traditional conflict of laws rule for determining the enforceability of a transfer or pledge of securities is based on the lex rei sitae principle (the validity of the disposition is determined by the law of the place where the securities are located). In order to address the legal and practical problems arising from the application of this approach in the modern context of indirectly held securities transactions, the Convention adopted the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Place of the Relevant Intermediary Approach\u00e2\u20ac\u009d (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153PRIMA\u00e2\u20ac\u009d), which has found favour around the world.  The first step to determine the choice of law is to look at the law expressly agreed between the account holder and its direct intermediary to govern the securities account. The choice of law, however, is constrained to the extent that the intermediary must have in the chosen State an office that regularly maintains securities accounts. If the account agreement does not contain such a choice of law clause, but expressly and unambiguously states that the relevant intermediary entered into the account agreement through a particular office, the applicable law is the law of the location of such office, provided that it regularly maintains securities accounts. If this test also provides no answer, the Convention considers, as the ultimate fallback, the law of the place of incorporation or organisation of the relevant intermediary.",

    "relevantInfo": "Although the incidence of marine casualties has decreased dramatically in recent years, mainly thanks to the work of IMO and the persistent efforts of Governments and industry to enhance safety in shipping operations, the number of abandoned wrecks, estimated at almost thirteen hundred worldwide, has reportedly increased and, as a result, the problems they cause to coastal States and shipping in general have, if anything, become more acute.  The problems faced by coastal states and shipping in general as a result of abandoned wrecks are three-fold: first, and depending on its location, a wreck may constitute a hazard to navigation, potentially endangering other vessels and their crews; second, and of equal concern, depending on the nature of the cargo, is the potential for a wreck to cause substantial damage to the marine and coastal environments; and third, in an age where goods and services are becoming increasingly expensive, is the issue of the costs involved in the marking and removal of hazardous wrecks. The convention attempts to resolve all of these and other, related, issues.",

A salvor who prevented a major pollution incident (for example, by towing a damaged tanker away from an environmentally sensitive area) but did not manage to save the ship or the cargo got nothing. There was therefore little incentive to a salvor to undertake an operation which has only a slim chance of success.

The Convention encourages scientific research and public access.</li>\n\t<li><strong><em>In Situ&nbsp;</em>Preservation as first option</strong> - The <em>in situ</em>&nbsp;preservation of underwater cultural heritage (i.e. in its original location on the seafloor) should be considered as the first option before allowing or engaging in any further&nbsp;activities. The recovery of objects may,&nbsp;however, be authorized for the purpose of making a significant contribution to the protection&nbsp;or knowledge of&nbsp;underwater cultural heritage.</li>\n\t<li><strong>No Commercial Exploitation</strong> - The 2001 Convention stipulates that underwater cultural heritage should not be commercially exploited for trade or speculation, and that it should not be irretrievably dispersed. This regulation is in conformity with the moral principles that already apply to cultural heritage on land. It is not to be understood as preventing archaeological research or tourist access.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Training and Information Sharing</strong> - States Parties shall cooperate and exchange information, promote training in underwater archaeology and promote public awareness regarding the value and importance of&nbsp;Underwater Cultural Heritage.</li>\n</ul>",

    "aboutInfo": "<p><strong>Purpose</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Convention is an instrument by which Parties to investment treaties concluded before 1 April 2014 express their consent to apply the <a href=\"http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/arbitration/2014Transparency.html\">UNCITRAL Rules on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor-State Arbitration</a> (&quot;Rules on Transparency&quot; or &quot;Rules&quot;). The Rules on Transparency, effective as of 1 April 2014, are a set of procedural rules for making publicly available information on investor-State arbitrations arising under investment treaties. In relation to investment treaties concluded prior to 1 April 2014, the Rules apply, inter alia, when Parties to the relevant investment treaty agree to their application. The Convention is an efficient and flexible mechanism for recording such agreement.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Key provisions</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Convention supplements existing investment treaties with respect to transparency-related obligations. Article 2, a key provision of the Convention, determines when and how the Rules on Transparency shall apply to investor-State arbitration within the scope of the Convention. In contrast to the Rules on Transparency, whether the arbitration is initiated under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules or not does not have any impact on the application of the Convention. The general rule of application is stipulated in paragraph 1 (bilateral or multilateral application) and paragraph 2 refers to the application of the Rules on Transparency when only the respondent State (and not the State of the investor-claimant) is a party to the Convention (unilateral offer of application).</p>\n\n<p>A Party to the Convention has the flexibility to formulate reservations, thereby excluding from the application of the Convention a specific investment treaty or a specific set of arbitration rules other than the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (negative-list approach). A Party may also declare that it will not provide a unilateral offer of application. Lastly, in the event the Rules on Transparency are revised, a Party may also declare, within a limited period of time after such revision, that it will not apply that revised version. By defining specific timing for the formulation and withdrawal of reservations, the Convention provides the necessary level of flexibility, while ensuring that reservations cannot be used to defeat the purpose of the Convention.</p>\n\n<p>The Convention and any reservation thereto apply prospectively, that is to arbitral proceedings commenced after the entry into force of the Convention for the Party concerned.</p>\n\n<p>Together with the Rules on Transparency, the Convention takes into the account both the public interest in such arbitration and the interest of the parties to resolve disputes in a fair and efficient manner. The Convention foresees the Secretary-General of the United Nations as performing the repository function, through the UNCITRAL secretariat (see the <a href=\"http://www.uncitral.org/transparency-registry/registry/index.jspx\">Transparency Registry</a>).</p>",

    "aboutInfo": "<p>The UNCITRAL Rules on Transparency in Treaty-based investor-State Arbitration (the &quot;Rules on Transparency&quot;), which come into effect on 1 April 2014, comprise a set of procedural rules that provide for transparency and accessibility to the public of treaty-based investor-State arbitration.</p>\n\n<p>The Rules on Transparency apply in relation to disputes arising out of treaties concluded prior to 1 April 2014, when Parties to the relevant treaty, or disputing parties, agree to their application. The Rules on Transparency apply in relation to disputes arising out of treaties concluded on or after 1 April 2014 (&quot;future treaties&quot;), when investor-State arbitration is initiated under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, unless the parties otherwise agree. The Rules on Transparency are also available for use in investor-State arbitrations initiated under rules other than the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, and in ad hoc proceedings.</p>\n\n<p>Given the link between the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules and the application of the Rules on Transparency, a new version of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (with new article 1, paragraph 4 as adopted in 2013) (the &quot;UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules 2013&quot;), will also come into effect on 1 April 2014. Such a revision (namely, the inclusion of a new paragraph 4 of article 1) ensures that the Rules on Transparency are clearly incorporated into the latest version of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, to provide for utmost clarity in relation to the application of the Rules on Transparency in disputes arising under future treaties and initiated under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. In all other respects the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules 2013 remain unchanged from the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (as revised in 2010).</p>\n\n<p>Information to be made available to the public under the Rules on Transparency shall be published by a central repository, a function undertaken by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, through the UNCITRAL secretariat.

He said all delegations showed &ldquo;an openness to discuss different approaches in a very positive spirit.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The President of the Diplomatic Conference Ambassador Luis Enrique Ch&aacute;vez Basagoitia, Permanent Representative of Peru to the United Nations Office and other international organizations in Geneva expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the diplomatic conference and called the adoption of the Geneva Act a &ldquo;transcendental moment&rdquo; for the Lisbon Union and WIPO.</p>\n\n<p>The Geneva Act of the Lisbon Agreement further develops the legal framework of the <a href=\"http://www.wipo.int/lisbon/en/\" target=\"_self\">Lisbon System</a>, which helps promote many globally marketed products such as, for example, Scotch whisky, Darjeeling tea and Caf&eacute; de Colombia.</p>\n\n<p>Other changes affect fee provisions, scope of protection, protection against becoming generic, and safeguards for respect of prior trademark rights.</p>\n\n<p>An official signing ceremony is scheduled for May 21, 2015, at WIPO&rsquo;s Geneva headquarters.</p>\n\n<p>The Geneva Act of the Lisbon Agreement will enter into force three months after five eligible parties have deposited their instruments of ratification or accession.</p>\n\n<p>The basic negotiating text for the Diplomatic Conference was developed between 2008 and 2014 by a Lisbon System working group with the goal of attracting a wider membership to the System, while preserving its principles and objectives.</p>\n\n<p>The Lisbon Agreement for the Protection of Appellations of Origin and their International Registration was originally concluded in 1958.</p>\n\n<h2>Background</h2>\n\n<p>Broadly speaking, a <a href=\"http://www.wipo.int/geo_indications/en/\" target=\"_self\">geographical indication</a> is a sign used on goods that have a specific geographical origin and possess qualities, reputation or characteristics that are essentially attributable to that place of origin. An appellation of origin is a similar type of sign, but often with more stringent criteria for usage.</p>\n\n<p>Appellations of originand geographical indications both require a qualitative link between the product to which they refer and its place of origin. Both inform consumers about a product&rsquo;s geographical origin and a quality, characteristic or reputation (for geographical indications) of the product linked to its place of origin. The basic difference between the two terms is that the link with the place of origin is stronger in the case of an appellation of origin.</p>\n\n<p>The quality or characteristics of a product protected as an appellation of origin must result exclusively or essentially from its geographical origin. This generally means that the raw materials should be sourced in the place of origin and that the processing of the product should also happen there.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of geographical indications, a single criterion attributable to geographical origin is sufficient for the geographical indication to qualify as such, which may also be the specific reputation of the product. Moreover, the production of the raw materials and the development or processing of a geographical indication product do not necessarily have to take place entirely in the defined geographical area.</p>\n\n<p>Additional examples of appellations of origin and geographical indications are Gouda Holland, Argan Oil, Swiss watches and Tequila.</p>",

Additionally, the agreement aims to strengthen the ability of countries to deal with the impacts of climate change. To reach these ambitious goals, appropriate financial flows, a new technology framework and an enhanced capacity building framework will be put in place, thus supporting action by developing countries and the most vulnerable countries, in line with their own national objectives.
